116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WENDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SILENTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GODS THAT DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVED THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORING IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUCE HIM
116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTENED TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASP HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURED TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDID DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT DOES NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLAPPING TRUTH INTO JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRUNO LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WETTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS MYTHUS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDOOS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MYTHS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS A MYTH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAN IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RESTLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FAITHS OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTION THE DEVOTION AND THE LABOR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR A REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHY THIS DISCREPANCY IN A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN OESTERA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MYTHUS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JESUS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTIERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TODAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TODAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS THE REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANY THING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 TWO THREE
1255-138279-0009 FOUR FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WELL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 O MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN ALAS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARNING MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO THAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK SO
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU HAVE HEARD SO
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 AND THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JOCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSTON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVICE CARO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE ABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOCELYN PIERSTON
1255-90413-0019 O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE AVON WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1272-128104-0000 MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER QUILTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LEIGHTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHACA
1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND AT EM PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IDYLLS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGO POEM MISTER BIRKET FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QUILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FACT
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
1272-128104-0009 HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES THE CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MANTEL BOARD
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FELICITOUS GRACE THAT MANY PHASES OF FEELING
1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOOD
1272-128104-0013 MISTER QUILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TUPPER OF PAINTING
1272-128104-0014 BY HARRY QUILTER M A
1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE
1272-135031-0001 HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR
1272-135031-0004 THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO
1272-135031-0007 HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY
1272-135031-0009 HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL
1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR NOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KALIKO
1272-135031-0012 WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW
1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST
1272-135031-0014 WHERE IS THAT
1272-135031-0015 THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO
1272-135031-0016 KALIKO HESITATED
1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
1272-135031-0018 OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T
1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY
1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE
1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY
1272-135031-0022 TRUE AGREED KALIKO
1272-135031-0023 KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST
1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOINCLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BUZZER SOUNDED
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZER'S WHIRR TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELAXATION
1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRANDD IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE
1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTIES
1272-141231-0014 HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL OUT
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
1272-141231-0016 TEN SECONDS
1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING
1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH TRAUMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTO HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED THE PROCESS
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
1272-141231-0028 IROLG LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
1272-141231-0029 HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
1272-141231-0030 BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROLG BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DOWSON ET CETERA
1462-170138-0001 HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CONNELL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY
1462-170138-0004 MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BURGOYNES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MAC CONNELL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TOWNE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMERE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWLE
1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
1462-170142-0004 A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
1462-170142-0023 I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024 AFTER THE VERY FIRST
1462-170142-0025 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
1462-170142-0029 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033 BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
1462-170142-0035 OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
1462-170142-0036 YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
1462-170142-0038 HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
1462-170142-0041 SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042 DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE OOZING WATER
1462-170145-0006 IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
1462-170145-0009 OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
1462-170145-0016 THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
1462-170145-0017 I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
1462-170145-0020 YES I KNOW VERY WELL
1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPARATUS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALED IN INVENTION THE SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD NEEDS SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LEADERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVATISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN RIPENING FAST
1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LIGHTING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN A CURIOUS MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE RIVALRIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN A FIELD WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EDISON STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FEUD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT EDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROPERTIES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID A SMALL SUM DOWN AND THE BALANCE ON MORTGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTER IN THE CHINESE TRADE WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS EDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOERCK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH EDISON ON TELEPHONE APPARATUS AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALTIES IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METERS SAFETY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LEASED THE OLD BISHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FOURTEENTH STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND I WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING AROUND
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS UTTER NEGLECT OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A CIGAR EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF CIGARS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OR NIGHTS EDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS REMENYI
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE
1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADDIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLING STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMP FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALL IN FURS
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD
1585-131718-0052 THEN I GOT PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 IT HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF BACKING EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON ITS GUILT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOLDED OUT OF FAULTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON A BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPLE THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAM STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORATORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLORIOUS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF BAT AND BITTERN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDID DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNY COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS REALM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHEUS UNTIL THE PORTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR THE NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATION FAILS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST IT PROMISES AND OFT IT HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS
1585-157660-0009 DEUCES WON DOUBLE AND SIXES TREBLE COIN
1585-157660-0010 WILLIAM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENTER POT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON A CAST AND WILL STAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BULL PUPS SHE WAS FONDLING IN HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCAL
1585-157660-0015 THE PRINTING SHOP OF FIELD WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURBAGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS BLUFF MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I HAVE FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPIC OF THE SOUL OF OUR PEOPLE THE MAHABHARATA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING SOULS INTO A PERMANENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALISE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PRATZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HEAD
1630-141772-0002 WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A WEAK SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LIFT THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ONTO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOVED AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK
1630-141772-0007 HE ASKED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDED A SQUADRON REPLIED REPNIN
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNIN NAMED LIEUTENANT SUKHTELEN
1630-141772-0010 AFTER LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON SMILED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUKHTELEN IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 A SPLENDID REPLY SAID NAPOLEON
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE ICON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SEWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THE STRETCHERS MOVED ON
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BALD HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
1630-141772-0022 HE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARREY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES OUR BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF OUR HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 MINE OWN
1630-73710-0005 WHAT DID WHAT COULD YOU DO
1630-73710-0006 I BEAT ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A SILLY BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO DAY
1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 HE IS ON MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FERDINAND TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HENRIETTA BUT I AM NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
1630-96099-0000 THAT TOO SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCK APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WANT HIM NEVER
1630-96099-0004 IDIOT TRIPLE IDIOT
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FORCE
1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT OR YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I ACCEPTED
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED FRIENDS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MONSIEUR
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MONSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFIDENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT PRAY
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MONSIEUR AND PIFF PAFF HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 WHY LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT ITALIAN
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRE A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HAH
1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN A GREAT HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEVIL
1630-96099-0024 HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
1650-157641-0002 BUT SIT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC
1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOT IN SOCIETY
1650-157641-0005 THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATED SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND DISTRUSTED THE MEN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FITZ BOODLE'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA THAT MANY A LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREE SCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A MAN
1650-157641-0012 PSHA LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE COGERS WERE ABOVE OR BELOW THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSORT DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEATS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE TEA
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT PIERRE'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF MOSCOW AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY ROUND WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
1650-167613-0003 SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN I CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOLLY
1650-167613-0007 PIERRE LOOKED AT TIMOKHIN WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID TIMOKHIN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
1650-167613-0009 WHY SO ASKED PIERRE
1650-167613-0010 THEN WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGER FORCES
1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND LOSSES WENT FOR NOTHING
1650-167613-0013 SO IT HAS BEEN WITH BARCLAY
1650-167613-0014 WHILE RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN
1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE'S A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PIERRE
1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY
1650-167613-0017 A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PIERRE
1650-167613-0018 PIERRE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAY THAT WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMOKHIN AND IN EACH SOLDIER
1650-167613-0023 A BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT AUSTERLITZ
1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOST SO LET US RUN AND WE RAN
1650-167613-0026 BUT TOMORROW WE SHAN'T SAY IT
1650-167613-0027 BUT WHAT AWAITS US TOMORROW
1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY DO NOT HELP MATTERS BUT HINDER
1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID TIMOKHIN
1650-167613-0030 IT'S NOT THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY
1650-167613-0031 ALL WERE SILENT THE OFFICERS ROSE
1650-167613-0032 YES YES ANSWERED PRINCE ANDREW ABSENTLY
1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAVE DESTROYED MY HOME AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO DESTROY MOSCOW THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THEY ARE MY ENEMIES
1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS
1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMOKHIN AND THE WHOLE ARMY
1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT TILSIT
1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PIERRE LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF THE RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUCE OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT'S ALL RUBBISH
1650-167613-0039 THEY PLUNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISSUE FALSE PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES
1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT KILL AND BE KILLED
1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MOSCOW WAS TAKEN AS SMOLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMP IN HIS THROAT
1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
1650-167613-0043 AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE WAR
1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN WARFARE
1650-167613-0045 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERYONE
1650-167613-0046 HOW DOES GOD ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM
1650-167613-0047 I SEE THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
1650-167613-0048 AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR MAN TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT'S NOT FOR LONG HE ADDED
1650-167613-0049 HOWEVER YOU'RE SLEEPY AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SLEEP
1650-167613-0050 GO BACK TO GORKI SAID PRINCE ANDREW SUDDENLY
1650-167613-0051 GO GO BEFORE A BATTLE ONE MUST HAVE ONE'S SLEEP OUT REPEATED PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED
1650-167613-0053 AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOMEONE FROM BAZDEEV'S WIDOW HAD CALLED TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOKS AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSAGE
1650-173551-0002 THE HALL PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE PIERRE STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAD SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIARCH'S PONDS WHERE THE WIDOW BAZDEEV'S HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH BAZDEEV'S NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPTS BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDITATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKAR ALEXEEVICH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS GALOSHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATINGLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE POKLONNY HILL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMA SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING WAS MAGICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THE VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES SCINTILLATING AND TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 BUT I SHALL SPARE HER
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE KREMLIN YES THERE IS THE KREMLIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST LAWS I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILIZATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LOVE
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DID NOT AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I HAVE WAGED WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MOSCOW I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AN HONORED MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 HE WILL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAID SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF A SIGNALING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH TVER KALUGA AND DOROGOMILOV GATES
1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTICK TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS ODD A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN
1651-136854-0007 PUBLICK CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENT OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRAISE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCY IN MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 BRUY
1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RETURN
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ENVY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIOURS EVERY ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NO THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOR OF THE FIRST PROSELYTE HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE AEONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PRAVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY
1673-143396-0011 A FOETUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENT TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLEROMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CERINTHUS
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHANASIUS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION
1673-143396-0018 HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOGOS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
1673-143396-0019 BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH
1673-143396-0020 UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABBOT SERAPION HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECCLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATIGABLE ARDOR THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PERUSED THE FOUR GOSPELS THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES AND THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
1673-143397-0000 ARDENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HERESY CYRIL AUSPICIOUSLY OPENED HIS REIGN BY OPPRESSING THE NOVATIANS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTARIES
1673-143397-0001 WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARCH AT THE DAWN OF DAY LED A SEDITIOUS MULTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE SYNAGOGUES
1673-143397-0002 SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMADVERSION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PROMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLONY
1673-143397-0003 THE ZEAL OF CYRIL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENALTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERNMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAISE
1673-143397-0004 ORESTES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THEODOSIUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PRAEFECT OF EGYPT
1673-143397-0005 A RUMOR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTIANS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE PRAEFECT AND THE ARCHBISHOP AND THAT OBSTACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED
1673-143397-0006 WHICH OPPRESSED THE METROPOLITANS OF EUROPE AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOCH AND ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DIOCESE BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE
1673-143397-0007 EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERETICS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS
1673-143397-0008 AT THESE BLASPHEMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN
1673-143397-0009 BUT THE VATICAN RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSENGERS OF EGYPT
1673-143397-0010 THE VANITY OF CELESTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSION OF A MONK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POPE WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLERGY WAS IGNORANT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS
1673-143397-0011 NESTORIUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS EASTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR CHRYSOSTOM TO DISCLAIM THE JURISDICTION AND TO DISOBEY THE SUMMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT
1673-143397-0012 SIXTY EIGHT BISHOPS TWENTY TWO OF METROPOLITAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODEST AND TEMPERATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHREN
1673-143397-0013 BY THE VIGILANCE OF MEMNON THE CHURCHES WERE SHUT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL
1673-143397-0014 DURING A BUSY PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPEROR TRIED EVERY METHOD EXCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONCILE THIS THEOLOGICAL QUARREL
1673-143397-0015 RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AND SCANDAL OF YOUR MEETING
1673-143397-0016 THE FEEBLE SON OF ARCADIUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAYED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE EUNUCHS AND WOMEN OF THE PALACE SUPERSTITION AND AVARICE WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHODOX CHIEFS WERE ASSIDUOUS IN THEIR ENDEAVORS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER
1673-143397-0017 BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHURCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DUTY
1673-143397-0018 AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVENUE OF THE THRONE WAS ASSAULTED WITH GOLD
1673-143397-0019 THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS UNPOPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECREASED THE NUMBER OF THE SCHISMATICS WHO REVERED NESTORIUS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THE FAITH
1673-143397-0020 A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMMYES OR NUBIANS INVADED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREAT THEY DISMISSED A CROWD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD NESTORIUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NILE THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AND ORTHODOX CITY TO THE MILDER SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES
1686-142278-0000 HE WAS GONE
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF BRIEFS SUCCESS AND ALL ITS SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
1686-142278-0008 MARGARET
1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD UNJUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN MEET THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAID FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COURSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW EMBARKED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT IN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 GOD FORGIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
1686-142278-0041 YES
1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARE SAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THIS VICARAGE
1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT AVAIL
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE PARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN THEN
1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY
1686-142278-0048 MARGARET I AM A POOR COWARD AFTER ALL I CANNOT BEAR TO GIVE PAIN
1686-142278-0049 YES INDEED SHE MUST SAID MARGARET
1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE MAY NOT OH YES
1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED' AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 MILTON NORTHERN
1686-142278-0054 YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET
1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO TELL YOUR MOTHER
1686-142278-0058 I AM GOING OUT FOR THE DAY TO BID FARMER DOBSON AND THE POOR PEOPLE ON BRACY COMMON GOOD BYE
1686-142278-0059 WOULD YOU DISLIKE BREAKING IT TO HER VERY MUCH MARGARET
1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF CRYING
1686-142278-0063 TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1686-142278-0069 SAID MISTER HALE THAT WOULD NOT ANSWER I MUST DO SOMETHING
1686-142278-0070 I CAN ALWAYS DECIDE BETTER BY MYSELF AND NOT INFLUENCED BY THOSE WHOM I LOVE SAID HE AS A HALF APOLOGY FOR HAVING ARRANGED SO MUCH BEFORE HE HAD TOLD ANY ONE OF HIS FAMILY OF HIS INTENTIONS
1686-142278-0071 I CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
1686-142278-0072 THEY MAKE ME SO UNDECIDED
1686-142278-0073 MISTER HALE CONTINUED A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN MY MISERY OF DOUBT BECAME MORE THAN I COULD BEAR WITHOUT SPEAKING I WROTE TO MISTER BELL YOU REMEMBER MISTER BELL MARGARET
1686-142278-0074 NO I NEVER SAW HIM I THINK
1686-142278-0075 AT ANY RATE HE HAS PROPERTY THERE WHICH HAS VERY MUCH INCREASED IN VALUE SINCE MILTON HAS BECOME SUCH A LARGE MANUFACTURING TOWN
1686-142278-0076 I DON'T KNOW THAT HE GAVE ME MUCH STRENGTH
1686-142278-0077 A PRIVATE TUTOR
1686-142278-0078 SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL WHAT IN THE WORLD DO MANUFACTURERS WANT WITH THE CLASSICS OR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN
1686-142278-0079 OH SAID HER FATHER SOME OF THEM REALLY SEEM TO BE FINE FELLOWS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES WHICH IS MORE THAN MANY A MAN AT OXFORD IS
1686-142278-0080 SOME WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE BETTER INSTRUCTED THAN THEY THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN
1686-142278-0081 AND IN MILTON MARGARET I SHALL FIND A BUSY LIFE IF NOT A HAPPY ONE AND PEOPLE AND SCENES SO DIFFERENT THAT I SHALL NEVER BE REMINDED OF HELSTONE
1686-142278-0082 DISCORDANT AS IT WAS WITH ALMOST A DETESTATION FOR ALL SHE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE MANUFACTURERS THE PEOPLE THE WILD AND BLEAK COUNTRY THERE WAS THIS ONE RECOMMENDATION IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM HELSTONE AND COULD NEVER REMIND THEM OF THAT BELOVED PLACE

1686-142278-0085 I WANTED TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU
1686-142278-0086 YOU SEE YOUR MOTHER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT YET BUT I THINK IN A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY DEED OF RESIGNATION IS SENT IN I SHALL HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMAIN
1686-142278-0087 MARGARET WAS ALMOST STUNNED
1686-142278-0088 BUT SHE RECOVERED HERSELF IMMEDIATELY
1686-142278-0089 YES PAPA IT HAD BETTER BE FIXED SOON AND DECIDEDLY AS YOU SAY
1686-142278-0090 POOR POOR MARIA

1686-142278-0093 YOU MUST NOT DECEIVE YOURSELF INTO DOUBTING THE REALITY OF MY WORDS MY FIXED INTENTION AND RESOLVE
1686-142278-0094 HE LOOKED AT HER IN THE SAME STEADY STONY MANNER FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
1686-142278-0095 THE BLESSING OF GOD BE UPON THEE MY CHILD
1686-142278-0096 THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FEARED LEST THIS ANSWER TO HIS BLESSING MIGHT BE IRREVERENT WRONG MIGHT HURT HIM AS COMING FROM HIS DAUGHTER AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK
1686-142278-0097 SHE HEARD HIM MURMUR TO HIMSELF THE MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS HAD EVEN MORE PAIN TO BEAR I WILL NOT SHRINK
1686-142278-0098 THEY WERE STARTLED BY HEARING MISSUS HALE INQUIRING FOR HER DAUGHTER
1701-141759-0000 IT WAS LONG SINCE THE ROSTOVS HAD NEWS OF NICHOLAS
1701-141759-0001 NOT TILL MIDWINTER WAS THE COUNT AT LAST HANDED A LETTER ADDRESSED IN HIS SON'S HANDWRITING
1701-141759-0002 ON RECEIVING IT HE RAN ON TIPTOE TO HIS STUDY IN ALARM AND HASTE TRYING TO ESCAPE NOTICE CLOSED THE DOOR AND BEGAN TO READ THE LETTER
1701-141759-0003 EACH TIME THAT THESE HINTS BEGAN TO MAKE THE COUNTESS ANXIOUS AND SHE GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE COUNT AND AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA THE LATTER VERY ADROITLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS
1701-141759-0004 BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW HOW IT MAY AFFECT YOUR MAMMA
1701-141759-0005 NO ON MY TRUE WORD OF HONOR SAID NATASHA CROSSING HERSELF I WON'T TELL ANYONE
1701-141759-0006 AND SHE RAN OFF AT ONCE TO SONYA
1701-141759-0007 SHE RUSHED TO SONYA HUGGED HER AND BEGAN TO CRY
1701-141759-0008 IT'S TRUE THAT ALL YOU WOMEN ARE CRYBABIES REMARKED PETYA PACING THE ROOM WITH LARGE RESOLUTE STRIDES
1701-141759-0009 YOU ARE ALL BLUBBERERS AND UNDERSTAND NOTHING
1701-141759-0010 NATASHA SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS
1701-141759-0011 WHAT NASTY BRUTES THEY ARE
1701-141759-0012 HOLD YOUR TONGUE PETYA WHAT A GOOSE YOU ARE
1701-141759-0013 SONYA SMILED DO I REMEMBER NICHOLAS
1701-141759-0014 I REMEMBER NIKOLENKA TOO I REMEMBER HIM WELL SHE SAID
1701-141759-0015 NO SHE SHUT HER EYES
1701-141759-0016 SHE FELT THAT SONYA WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH THAT THERE WAS SUCH LOVE AS SONYA WAS SPEAKING OF
1701-141759-0017 SHE BELIEVED IT COULD BE BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
1701-141759-0018 SHALL YOU WRITE TO HIM SHE ASKED
1701-141759-0019 NOW THAT HE WAS ALREADY AN OFFICER AND A WOUNDED HERO WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO REMIND HIM OF HERSELF AND AS IT MIGHT SEEM OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO HER HE HAD TAKEN ON HIMSELF
1701-141759-0020 I DON'T KNOW
1701-141759-0021 SONYA SMILED NO
1701-141759-0022 IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT FAT ONE IN SPECTACLES THAT WAS HOW PETYA DESCRIBED HIS NAMESAKE THE NEW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT SINGER HE MEANT NATASHA'S ITALIAN SINGING MASTER THAT'S WHY SHE'S ASHAMED
1701-141759-0023 PETYA YOU'RE A STUPID SAID NATASHA
1701-141759-0024 THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN PREPARED BY ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S HINTS AT DINNER
1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER SON ON THE LID OF A SNUFFBOX WHILE THE TEARS KEPT COMING INTO HER EYES
1701-141759-0026 THE COUNT PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEYHOLE AND LISTENED
1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE DOOR
1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS CRYING
1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL HE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE GLAD AND NOT CRY
1701-141759-0032 HOW CHARMINGLY HE DESCRIBES SAID SHE READING THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THE LETTER AND WHAT A SOUL
1701-141759-0033 I ALWAYS SAID WHEN HE WAS ONLY SO HIGH I ALWAYS SAID
1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOGRADS HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO OLMUTZ TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINE THE HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEP A PRACTICE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
1701-141760-0003 BORIS HAD BEEN QUARTERED AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THROUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S STAFF
1701-141760-0005 BERG AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMARKED
1701-141760-0007 AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED
1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME HOW YOU HAVE CHANGED
1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS FRIEND BUT NICHOLAS AVOIDED HIM
1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS
1701-141760-0013 I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TODAY HE ADDED
1701-141760-0014 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS RODE WITH OUR REGIMENT ALL THE TIME SO THAT WE HAD EVERY COMFORT AND EVERY ADVANTAGE
1701-141760-0015 WHAT RECEPTIONS WE HAD IN POLAND
1701-141760-0016 WHAT DINNERS AND BALLS I CAN'T TELL YOU
1701-141760-0017 OH YOU GUARDS SAID ROSTOV I SAY SEND FOR SOME WINE
1701-141760-0018 HE WENT TO HIS BED DREW A PURSE FROM UNDER THE CLEAN PILLOW AND SENT FOR WINE
1701-141760-0019 YES AND I HAVE SOME MONEY AND A LETTER TO GIVE YOU HE ADDED
1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT COUNT I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BERG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOSTS THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
1701-141760-0025 IN THE LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMED
1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE DAY
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKONSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BERG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SAY IT
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE HOME
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
174-168635-0000 HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND
174-168635-0001 THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY
174-168635-0002 HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM
174-168635-0003 HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING
174-168635-0004 ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
174-168635-0005 COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING
174-168635-0006 SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION
174-168635-0007 THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY
174-168635-0008 NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF
174-168635-0009 TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER
174-168635-0010 WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
174-168635-0011 MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL
174-168635-0012 HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN
174-168635-0013 WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL
174-168635-0014 COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING
174-168635-0015 AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY
174-168635-0016 HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE
174-168635-0017 THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS
174-168635-0018 HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISGUST AND LASSITUDE WERE OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SURE TO REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM
174-168635-0019 WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE
174-168635-0020 ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE
174-168635-0021 HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM
174-168635-0022 HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PROP
174-50561-0000 FORGOTTEN TOO THE NAME OF GILLIAN THE LOVELY CAPTIVE
174-50561-0001 WORSE AND WORSE HE IS EVEN PRESUMED TO BE THE CAPTIVE'S SWEETHEART WHO WHEEDLES THE FLOWER THE RING AND THE PRISON KEY OUT OF THE STRICT VIRGINS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND FLIES WITH HER AT LAST IN HIS SHALLOP ACROSS THE SEA TO LIVE WITH HER HAPPILY EVER AFTER
174-50561-0002 BUT THIS IS A FALLACY
174-50561-0003 THE WANDERING SINGER APPROACHES THEM WITH HIS LUTE
174-50561-0004 THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
174-50561-0005 LADY LADY MY ROSE WHITE LADY BUT WILL YOU NOT HEAR A ROUNDEL LADY
174-50561-0006 O IF YOU PLAY US A ROUNDEL SINGER HOW CAN THAT HARM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
174-50561-0007 SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK THOUGH WE DANCED A WEEK WITH HER THOUGHTS A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER
174-50561-0008 BUT IF I PLAY YOU A ROUNDEL LADY GET ME A GIFT FROM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER HER FINGER RING FOR MY FINGER BRING THOUGH SHE'S PLEDGED A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY ROSE WHITE LADY
174-50561-0009 THE WANDERING SINGER
174-50561-0010 BUT I DID ONCE HAVE THE LUCK TO HEAR AND SEE THE LADY PLAYED IN ENTIRETY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN GRANTED LEAVE TO PLAY JUST ONE MORE GAME BEFORE BED TIME AND OF COURSE THEY CHOSE THE LONGEST AND PLAYED IT WITHOUT MISSING A SYLLABLE
174-50561-0011 THE LADIES IN YELLOW DRESSES STAND AGAIN IN A RING ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER AND ARE FOR THE LAST TIME ACCOSTED BY THE SINGER WITH HIS LUTE
174-50561-0012 THE WANDERING SINGER
174-50561-0013 I'LL PLAY FOR YOU NOW NEATH THE APPLE BOUGH AND YOU SHALL DREAM ON THE LAWN SO SHADY LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY APPLE GOLD LADY
174-50561-0014 THE LADIES
174-50561-0015 NOW YOU MAY PLAY A SERENA SINGER A DREAM OF NIGHT FOR AN APPLE GOLD LADY FOR THE FRUIT IS NOW ON THE APPLE BOUGH AND THE MOON IS UP AND THE LAWN IS SHADY SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER
174-50561-0016 ONCE MORE THE SINGER PLAYS AND THE LADIES DANCE BUT ONE BY ONE THEY FALL ASLEEP TO THE DROWSY MUSIC AND THEN THE SINGER STEPS INTO THE RING AND UNLOCKS THE TOWER AND KISSES THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
174-50561-0017 I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF THE LADIES
174-50561-0018 BED TIME CHILDREN
174-50561-0019 YOU SEE THE TREATMENT IS A TRIFLE FANCIFUL
174-84280-0000 HOW WE MUST SIMPLIFY
174-84280-0001 IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY
174-84280-0002 IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
174-84280-0003 WE RANGE WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
174-84280-0004 AND ALREADY THIS ASTOUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FUTILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD
174-84280-0005 FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARY OBSCURED HER LIFE FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN
174-84280-0006 IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMINATED MY MIND IN A STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JUSTIN
174-84280-0007 I BECAME GROTESQUELY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGHOUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER
174-84280-0008 YOU WERE WRONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE KEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU
174-84280-0009 WE NEVER PLANNED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET
174-84280-0010 IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING
174-84280-0011 BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH
174-84280-0012 AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING
174-84280-0013 IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMT OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION
174-84280-0014 WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER
174-84280-0015 SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISCIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST TRADITION THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX
1919-142785-0000 ILLUSTRATION LONG PEPPER
1919-142785-0001 LONG PEPPER THIS IS THE PRODUCE OF A DIFFERENT PLANT FROM THAT WHICH PRODUCES THE BLACK IT CONSISTING OF THE HALF RIPE FLOWER HEADS OF WHAT NATURALISTS CALL PIPER LONGUM AND CHABA

1988-147956-0009 THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORNCAKES AND SORGHUM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS
1988-147956-0010 I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES
1988-147956-0011 HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR
1988-147956-0012 EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
1988-147956-0013 HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART
1988-147956-0014 AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER

1988-147956-0017 IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA
1988-147956-0018 I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
1988-147956-0019 WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
1988-147956-0020 THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
1988-147956-0021 SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY

1988-147956-0029 I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
1988-148538-0001 AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE
1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
1988-148538-0010 IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
1988-148538-0011 IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE TO THEM
1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUERILE JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
1988-24833-0000 THE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME

1988-24833-0019 I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
1988-24833-0020 I TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S THE SPOOK AFTER ALL

1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAYS HILDA
1988-24833-0023 TOM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
1988-24833-0024 TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JOB
1988-24833-0025 YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY
1988-24833-0027 I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM

1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
1993-147149-0009 BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
1993-147149-0010 WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
1993-147149-0011 THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
1993-147149-0012 HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
1993-147149-0013 MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
1993-147149-0014 THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
1993-147149-0015 AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YO HAN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
1993-147149-0017 OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
1993-147149-0019 DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF

1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
1993-147149-0022 SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY

1993-147149-0026 BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONDS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER
1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON

1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
1993-147966-0002 YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
1993-147966-0003 FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE
1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
1993-147966-0005 THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
2035-147960-0001 THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED
2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADY AS WINE
2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
2035-147960-0005 I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
2035-147960-0006 I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
2035-147960-0009 LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE
2035-147960-0013 OTTO FUCHS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
2035-147960-0014 HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
2035-147960-0015 OTTO WINKED AT ME
2035-147960-0016 A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
2035-147961-0013 ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
2035-147961-0017 MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS
2035-147961-0020 A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
2035-147961-0021 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
2035-147961-0026 THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
2035-147961-0027 YES HOW MANY
2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
2035-147961-0029 NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
2035-147961-0030 PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
2035-147961-0036 DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
2035-147961-0037 EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
2035-147961-0039 WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
2035-147961-0040 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
2035-152373-0000 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES
2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA
2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY
2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE
2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE
2035-152373-0006 LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN
2035-152373-0007 THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGAL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNACTA
2035-152373-0008 AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER
2035-152373-0009 THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNISE AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT AIDAN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA
2035-152373-0010 THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER
2035-152373-0011 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE
2035-152373-0015 HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST
2035-152373-0016 THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
2035-152373-0017 SAINT MOLING SURVIVED HIM THREE YEARS AND SAINT ADAMNAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS
2035-152373-0018 NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN SUCH AN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A PERIOD

2078-142845-0004 MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A LARGE EARTHENWARE BOWL OR DEEP PAN THEN WITH A STRONG METAL OR WOODEN SPOON HOLLOW OUT THE MIDDLE BUT DO NOT CLEAR IT ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AS IN THAT CASE THE SPONGE OR LEAVEN AS IT WAS FORMERLY TERMED WOULD STICK TO IT WHICH IT OUGHT NOT TO DO
2078-142845-0005 NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BREWER'S YEAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR NEARLY AN OUNCE OF GERMAN YEAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MIX IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH THREE QUARTERS PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD
2078-142845-0006 LOOK AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IT HAS BEEN LAID FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN THE YEAST HAS RISEN AND BROKEN THROUGH THE FLOUR SO THAT BUBBLES APPEAR IN IT YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS READY TO BE MADE UP INTO DOUGH
2078-142845-0007 THEN PLACE THE PAN ON A STRONG CHAIR OR DRESSER OR TABLE OF CONVENIENT HEIGHT POUR INTO THE SPONGE THE REMAINDER OF THE WARM MILK AND WATER STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THE FLOUR AS YOU CAN WITH THE SPOON THEN WIPE IT OUT CLEAN WITH YOUR FINGERS AND LAY IT ASIDE

2078-142845-0012 IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO ITALY WHERE THEY MAKE A COARSE BREAD FROM IT AND IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN PASTRY AND PUDDINGS THEY ALSO USE IT FOR FEEDING HORSES AND DOMESTIC FOWLS
2078-142845-0013 A YELLOW VARIETY CALLED GOLDEN MILLET IS SOLD IN THE GROCERS SHOPS FOR MAKING PUDDINGS AND IS VERY DELICATE AND WHOLESOME

2078-142845-0026 TO MAKE DRY TOAST
2078-142845-0027 NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING ANY KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT
2078-142845-0028 MOVE IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UNTIL THE BREAD IS NICELY COLOURED THEN TURN IT AND TOAST THE OTHER SIDE AND DO NOT PLACE IT SO NEAR THE FIRE THAT IT BLACKENS
2078-142845-0029 TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX
2078-142845-0030 A LOAF OF HOUSEHOLD BREAD ABOUT TWO DAYS OLD ANSWERS FOR MAKING TOAST BETTER THAN COTTAGE BREAD THE LATTER NOT BEING A GOOD SHAPE AND TOO CRUSTY FOR THE PURPOSE
2078-142845-0031 CUT AS MANY NICE EVEN SLICES AS MAY BE REQUIRED RATHER MORE THAN ONE QUARTER INCH IN THICKNESS AND TOAST THEM BEFORE A VERY BRIGHT FIRE WITHOUT ALLOWING THE BREAD TO BLACKEN WHICH SPOILS THE APPEARANCE AND FLAVOUR OF ALL TOAST
2078-142845-0032 SOYER RECOMMENDS THAT EACH SLICE SHOULD BE CUT INTO PIECES AS SOON AS IT IS BUTTERED AND WHEN ALL ARE READY THAT THEY SHOULD BE PILED LIGHTLY ON THE DISH THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE SERVED ON
2078-142845-0033 HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE UPPER ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT LIQUID
2078-142845-0034 MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SERVED ON SEPARATE DISHES AND BOTH TOASTED AND SERVED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE

2086-149214-0000 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSEBUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND A PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS
2086-149220-0002 THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF SOME PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING
2086-149220-0003 SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STOCK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST
2086-149220-0004 PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY
2086-149220-0005 BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDE SOME FARM HOUSE MILES AWAY
2086-149220-0006 THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES
2086-149220-0007 IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKEN
2086-149220-0008 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE
2086-149220-0009 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE
2086-149220-0010 THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE A BREED OF FOWLS
2086-149220-0011 THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HENS WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPZIBAH'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE
2086-149220-0012 THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PALES OF THE COOP AND RAN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER
2086-149220-0013 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
2086-149220-0014 HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES
2086-149220-0015 THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD
2086-149220-0016 MISS HEPZIBAH I SUPPOSE WILL INTERWEAVE THE FACT WITH HER OTHER TRADITIONS AND SET IT DOWN THAT THE FOWLS KNOW YOU TO BE A PYNCHEON
2086-149220-0017 AH BUT THESE HENS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THESE HENS OF ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARN YARD FOWL
2086-149220-0018 I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPZIBAH THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PYNCHEON
2086-149220-0019 MY NAME IS PHOEBE PYNCHEON SAID THE GIRL WITH A MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE DAGUERREOTYPIST OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA
2086-149220-0020 I TURN UP THE EARTH BY WAY OF PASTIME
2086-149220-0021 IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT
2086-149220-0022 IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE DAGUERREOTYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE
2086-149220-0023 MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO
2086-149220-0024 THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BROAD AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE
2086-149220-0025 WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT
2086-149220-0026 YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
2086-149220-0027 HE EXHIBITED A DAGUERREOTYPE MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE
2086-149220-0028 PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK
2086-149220-0029 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET
2086-149220-0030 THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART
2086-149220-0031 HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITHAL COLD AS ICE LOOK AT THAT EYE
2086-149220-0032 AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL
2086-149220-0033 WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT
2086-149220-0034 IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SUN TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD
2086-149220-0035 IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
2086-149220-0036 IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
2086-149220-0037 SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE
2086-149220-0038 SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABORERS SOMEWHAT ON THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM
2086-149220-0039 SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE HIM
2086-149220-0040 OH REJOINED THE DAGUERREOTYPIST BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED
2086-149220-0041 SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEK TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARDS A CORNER
2086-149220-0042 BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE
2086-149220-0043 WHAT AN INSTRUMENT IS THE HUMAN VOICE
2086-149220-0044 HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL
2086-149220-0045 FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM
2086-149220-0046 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST
2086-149220-0047 I WILL SIT IN THE PARLOR AWHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
2086-149220-0048 WHILE THUS DISMISSING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPT FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND TUMULTUOUS SWELL
2086-149220-0049 AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION
2277-149874-0000 MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABOURERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
2277-149874-0001 TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL
2277-149874-0002 TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
2277-149874-0003 HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE
2277-149874-0004 HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
2277-149874-0005 SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION
2277-149874-0006 THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED
2277-149874-0007 THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN RAG CARPET
2277-149874-0008 THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT
2277-149874-0009 ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING
2277-149874-0010 NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE
2277-149874-0011 HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
2277-149874-0012 MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
2277-149874-0013 YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR
2277-149874-0014 SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROUET'S CARD AND WROTE HIM
2277-149874-0015 SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID
2277-149874-0016 ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID SAY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH
2277-149874-0017 A SHOP GIRL WAS THE DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEWCOMER
2277-149874-0018 IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
2277-149874-0019 NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE
2277-149874-0020 IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET
2277-149874-0021 THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY
2277-149896-0000 HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
2277-149896-0001 HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
2277-149896-0002 HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION
2277-149896-0003 HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION
2277-149896-0004 HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT
2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED
2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
2277-149896-0009 WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DROUET THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
2277-149896-0011 HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
2277-149896-0012 SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON CAR
2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE
2277-149896-0016 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL
2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH
2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE
2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
2277-149896-0025 HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
2277-149896-0027 HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTENCY OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA
2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW
2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
2277-149896-0033 THEN HE RANG THE BELL NO ANSWER
2277-149896-0034 HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
2277-149897-0000 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
2277-149897-0002 NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
2277-149897-0008 ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
2277-149897-0010 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT
2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
2277-149897-0021 HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
2277-149897-0024 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
2277-149897-0035 VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
2277-149897-0037 IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
2412-153947-0000 PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
2412-153947-0001 THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER
2412-153947-0003 THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY
2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
2412-153947-0006 BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGITATA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
2412-153947-0009 I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
2412-153947-0010 I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
2412-153947-0012 THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOULDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
2412-153947-0014 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO
2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
2412-153948-0007 THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
2412-153948-0008 IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
2412-153948-0009 IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
2412-153948-0010 THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
2412-153954-0001 MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM
2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
2412-153954-0003 THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
2412-153954-0005 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
2412-153954-0008 THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL
2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN
2412-153954-0010 THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
2412-153954-0014 IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
2412-153954-0015 SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
2412-153954-0018 THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
2412-153954-0019 BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
2412-153954-0020 AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
2412-153954-0022 THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
2412-153954-0023 THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER
2428-83699-0000 I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON
2428-83699-0001 FESTIVE YES
2428-83699-0002 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
2428-83699-0003 IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER
2428-83699-0004 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD
2428-83699-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
2428-83699-0006 NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
2428-83699-0007 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
2428-83699-0008 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO
2428-83699-0009 I HAD NO ILLUSIONS
2428-83699-0010 I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
2428-83699-0011 ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING
2428-83699-0012 I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
2428-83699-0013 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
2428-83699-0014 IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY
2428-83699-0015 HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
2428-83699-0016 IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
2428-83699-0017 WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
2428-83699-0018 NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGAR DENE THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
2428-83699-0019 THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY AND BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
2428-83699-0020 WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART
2428-83699-0021 IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE
2428-83699-0022 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
2428-83699-0023 I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
2428-83699-0024 I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
2428-83699-0025 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
2428-83699-0026 HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
2428-83699-0027 THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
2428-83699-0028 THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF
2428-83699-0029 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
2428-83699-0030 NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
2428-83699-0031 BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
2428-83699-0032 MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING
2428-83699-0033 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
2428-83699-0034 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
2428-83699-0035 A VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE
2428-83699-0036 THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
2428-83699-0037 THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
2428-83699-0038 WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
2428-83699-0039 I TOLLED THE BELL AGAIN
2428-83699-0040 AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
2428-83699-0041 I'M MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON
2428-83699-0042 WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
2428-83705-0000 HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANN'S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
2428-83705-0003 IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
2428-83705-0006 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
2428-83705-0008 I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED
2428-83705-0009 THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE
2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
2428-83705-0013 IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS
2428-83705-0014 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTYE FOR ALL I KNOW
2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
2428-83705-0017 I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
2428-83705-0021 I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
2428-83705-0022 A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT
2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
2428-83705-0027 HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
2428-83705-0029 I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
2428-83705-0031 SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MACPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
2428-83705-0036 SOMEONE SNIGGERED
2428-83705-0037 I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE
2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
2428-83705-0039 P S THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING
2428-83705-0040 WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
2428-83705-0041 A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANN'S IS IN THE COOK'S TOURS LINE
2428-83705-0042 HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
2428-83705-0043 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE
2506-11267-0000 I SEE SHOALS OF THEM DEPART NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THE ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS
2506-11267-0001 FAREWELL DEAR FRIENDS I SAY YOU LITTLE KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REGARDS YOU FROM THE BEACH IS YOUR FRIEND AND HISTORIOGRAPHER AND BROTHER
2506-11267-0002 I WENT TO DAY TO SEE OUR EXCELLENT FRIEND SNOOKS ON BOARD THE QUEEN OF THE FRENCH MANY SCORES OF SNOBS WERE THERE ON THE DECK OF THAT FINE SHIP MARCHING FORTH IN THEIR PRIDE AND BRAVERY
2506-11267-0003 THEY WILL BE AT OSTEND IN FOUR HOURS THEY WILL INUNDATE THE CONTINENT NEXT WEEK THEY WILL CARRY INTO FAR LANDS THE FAMOUS IMAGE OF THE BRITISH SNOB
2506-11267-0004 I HAVE SEEN SNOBS IN PINK COATS AND HUNTING BOOTS SCOURING OVER THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME AND HAVE HEARD THEIR OATHS AND THEIR WELL KNOWN SLANG IN THE GALLERIES OF THE VATICAN AND UNDER THE SHADOWY ARCHES OF THE COLOSSEUM
2506-11267-0005 MY LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ROUND WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TERROR AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIP AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK
2506-11267-0006 THERE SHE SITS AND WILL BE ILL IN PRIVATE
2506-11267-0007 THE STRAWBERRY LEAVES ON HER CHARIOT PANELS ARE ENGRAVED ON HER LADYSHIP'S HEART
2506-11267-0008 AND DAVIS YOU'D BEST TAKE THE PISTOL CASE INTO THE CABIN
2506-11267-0009 LOOK AT HONEST NATHAN HOUNDSDITCH AND HIS LADY AND THEIR LITTLE SON
2506-11267-0010 WHAT A NOBLE AIR OF BLAZING CONTENTMENT ILLUMINATES THE FEATURES OF THOSE SNOBS OF EASTERN RACE
2506-11267-0011 WHAT A TOILETTE HOUNDSDITCH'S IS
2506-11267-0012 HE WILL NEVER SPARE HIMSELF ANY CHEAP ENJOYMENT
2506-11267-0013 I HAVE SAID BEFORE I LIKE TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLES ON THEIR GALA DAYS THEY ARE SO PICTURESQUELY AND OUTRAGEOUSLY SPLENDID AND HAPPY
2506-11267-0014 YONDER COMES CAPTAIN BULL SPICK AND SPAN TIGHT AND TRIM WHO TRAVELS FOR FOUR OR SIX MONTHS EVERY YEAR OF HIS LIFE WHO DOES NOT COMMIT HIMSELF BY LUXURY OF RAIMENT OR INSOLENCE OF DEMEANOUR BUT I THINK IS AS GREAT A SNOB AS ANY MAN ON BOARD
2506-11267-0015 BULL PASSES THE SEASON IN LONDON SPONGING FOR DINNERS AND SLEEPING IN A GARRET NEAR HIS CLUB
2506-11267-0016 SEE HE IS UP TO OLD CARABAS ALREADY I TOLD YOU HE WOULD
2506-11267-0017 THAT BROAD SHOULDERED BUCK WITH THE GREAT WHISKERS AND THE CLEANED WHITE KID GLOVES IS MISTER PHELIM CLANCY OF POLDOODYSTOWN HE CALLS HIMSELF MISTER DE CLANCY HE ENDEAVOURS TO DISGUISE HIS NATIVE BROGUE WITH THE RICHEST SUPERPOSITION OF ENGLISH AND IF YOU PLAY AT BILLIARDS OR ECARTE WITH HIM THE CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL WIN THE FIRST GAME AND HE THE SEVEN OR EIGHT GAMES ENSUING
2506-11267-0018 THE NEXT PERSON IS BUT HARK
2506-11278-0000 WHEN A GROSS INSTANCE OF SNOBBISHNESS HAPPENS WHY SHOULD NOT THE INDIGNANT JOURNALIST CALL THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THAT DELINQUENCY TOO
2506-11278-0001 HOW FOR INSTANCE COULD THAT WONDERFUL CASE OF THE EARL OF MANGELWURZEL AND HIS BROTHER BE EXAMINED IN THE SNOBBISH POINT OF VIEW
2506-11278-0002 ALL WE REQUIRE IS THAT A MAN SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO US BY THE EARL OF MANGELWURZELSHIRE
2506-11278-0003 O YOU PRIDE OF ALL SNOBLAND
2506-11278-0004 O YOU CRAWLING TRUCKLING SELF CONFESSED LACKEYS AND PARASITES
2506-11278-0005 IT WAS HER SNOBBISH SENTIMENT THAT MISLED HER AND MADE HER VANITIES A PREY TO THE SWINDLING FORTUNE TELLER
2506-11278-0006 HOW WOULD YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE PRODIGIOUS BENEVOLENCE EXERCISED TOWARDS THE INTERESTING YOUNG FRENCH LADY
2506-11278-0007 THE HONEST BOARDING HOUSE PEOPLE WERE AT HER FEET AT ONCE
2506-11278-0008 GOOD HONEST SIMPLE LORD LOVING CHILDREN OF SNOBLAND
2506-11278-0009 FINALLY THERE WAS THE CASE OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MISTER VERNON AT YORK
2506-11278-0010 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WAS THE SON OF A NOBLEMAN AND PRACTISED ON AN OLD LADY
2506-11278-0011 THEN HE CAST HIS NETS OVER A FAMILY OF FATHER MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS ONE OF WHOM HE PROPOSED TO MARRY
2506-11278-0012 ONE DAY THE TRAITOR FLED WITH A TEAPOT AND A BASKETFUL OF COLD VICTUALS
2506-11278-0013 IT WAS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WHICH BAITED THE HOOK WHICH GORGED ALL THESE GREEDY SIMPLE SNOBS
2506-11278-0014 WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN BY A COMMONER
2506-11278-0015 ALAS AND ALAS WHAT MORTAL MAN THAT SPEAKS THE TRUTH CAN HOPE FOR SUCH A LANDLADY
2506-11278-0016 AND YET ALL THESE INSTANCES OF FOND AND CREDULOUS SNOBBISHNESS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE SAME WEEK'S PAPER WITH WHO KNOWS HOW MANY SCORE MORE
2506-11278-0017 WE ARE THREE SISTERS FROM SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWO
2506-11278-0018 WE ARE JUST THE SAME TO PERSONS WITH A HANDLE TO THEIR NAME AS TO THOSE WITHOUT IT
2506-11278-0019 IF YOU DO I CANNOT HELP IT BUT I AM OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION AND ENTERTAIN A LINGERING HOPE
2506-11278-0020 EXCUSE THIS SCRAWL BUT I ALWAYS WRITE HEADLONG
2506-11278-0021 WE NEVER WRITE ON PERFUMED PAPER IN SHORT I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT IF YOU KNEW US YOU WOULD NOT THINK US SNOBS
2506-11278-0022 I SHALL HAVE A BLACK CRAPE ROUND MY WHITE HAT AND MY USUAL BAMBOO CANE WITH THE RICHLY GILT KNOB
2506-11278-0023 I AM SORRY THERE WILL BE NO TIME TO GET UP MOUSTACHES BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT WEEK
2506-11278-0024 FROM SEVENTEEN TO TWO AND TWENTY YE GODS WHAT AGES
2506-11278-0025 DEAR YOUNG CREATURES I CAN SEE YOU ALL THREE

2506-11278-0028 PEACE PEACE THOU SILLY LITTLE FLUTTERING HEART
2506-11278-0029 YOU SNOBS DEAR YOUNG LADIES
2506-11278-0030 I WILL PULL ANY MAN'S NOSE WHO SAYS SO
2506-11278-0031 THERE IS NO HARM IN BEING OF A GOOD FAMILY
2506-11278-0032 YOU CAN'T HELP IT POOR DEARS WHAT'S IN A NAME
2506-11278-0033 THAT VERY CONFIDENCE SAVOURS OF ARROGANCE AND TO BE ARROGANT IS TO BE A SNOB
2506-11278-0034 BUT ARE THERE NO KINDLY NATURES NO TENDER HEARTS NO SOULS HUMBLE SIMPLE AND TRUTH LOVING
2506-11278-0035 PONDER WELL ON THIS QUESTION SWEET YOUNG LADIES
2506-13150-0000 PRAY CAPTAIN QUOTH I AS I WAS GOING DOWN INTO THE CABIN IS A MAN NEVER OVERTAKEN BY DEATH IN THIS PASSAGE
2506-13150-0001 WHY THERE IS NOT TIME FOR A MAN TO BE SICK IN IT REPLIED HE WHAT A CURSED LYAR FOR I AM SICK AS A HORSE QUOTH I ALREADY WHAT A BRAIN UPSIDE DOWN HEY DAY
2506-13150-0002 SICK SICK

2506-13150-0004 WHEN SHALL WE GET TO LAND
2506-13150-0005 THE WIND CHOPP'D ABOUT
2506-13150-0006 S'DEATH THEN I SHALL MEET HIM FULL IN THE FACE
2506-13150-0007 CAPTAIN QUOTH SHE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET US GET ASHORE
2506-13150-0008 WAS NOT DEMOCRITUS WHO LAUGHED TEN TIMES MORE THAN I TOWN CLERK OF ABDERA
2506-13150-0009 NAY IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU MAY READ THE CHAPTER FOR YOUR PAINS
2506-169427-0000 INTEREST HOWEVER STILL RUNS ON IN BOTH CASES THE PERIODICAL OR ACCIDENTAL PAYMENTS OF IT JUST SERVING TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF THE AFFAIR ALIVE TILL AT LENGTH IN SOME EVIL HOUR POP COMES THE CREDITOR UPON EACH AND BY DEMANDING PRINCIPAL UPON THE SPOT TOGETHER WITH FULL INTEREST TO THE VERY DAY MAKES THEM BOTH FEEL THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS
2506-169427-0001 AS THE READER FOR I HATE YOUR IFS HAS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HERO COULD NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MEMENTOS
2506-169427-0002 TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOK DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIUS'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THRO ANY MALIGNANCY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOUR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSS'D OUT IN COURSE
2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MITE
2506-169427-0004 WHAT INCLINED EUGENIUS TO THE SAME OPINION WAS AS FOLLOWS
2506-169427-0005 YORICK FOLLOWED EUGENIUS WITH HIS EYES TO THE DOOR HE THEN CLOSED THEM AND NEVER OPENED THEM MORE
2506-169427-0006 ALAS POOR YORICK
251-118436-0000 HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE
251-118436-0001 I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED
251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
251-118436-0003 AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW
251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANED FROM HIS MOUTH
251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER
251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY
251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR
251-118436-0009 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDHYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
251-118436-0010 POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER
251-118436-0011 ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS
251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KHOSALA WHO LOVED BHUNDA CHAND VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT
251-118436-0014 ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS
251-118436-0015 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
251-118436-0016 THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
251-118436-0017 THEIR FINGERS SEAR ME LIKE FIRE
251-118436-0018 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE
251-118436-0019 THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH
251-118436-0020 YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
251-118436-0021 THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER
251-118436-0022 YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
251-118436-0023 SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO ASURA
251-136532-0000 THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA
251-136532-0001 BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS
251-136532-0002 THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
251-136532-0003 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
251-136532-0004 THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
251-136532-0005 THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME
251-136532-0006 TONY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS
251-136532-0007 IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
251-136532-0008 GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM
251-136532-0009 WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION
251-136532-0010 MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
251-136532-0011 NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
251-136532-0012 A FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATTIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
251-136532-0013 MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
251-136532-0014 YES CHARCOAL
251-136532-0015 SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
251-136532-0016 THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
251-136532-0017 TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
251-136532-0018 WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
251-136532-0019 NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
251-136532-0020 BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT
251-136532-0021 SO I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
251-136532-0022 LECTURES
251-136532-0023 THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATTIMER PH D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR
251-137823-0000 I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE REPLIED
251-137823-0001 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND
251-137823-0002 THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TESTING ROUTINE IS IT
251-137823-0003 ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE
251-137823-0004 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH
251-137823-0005 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING MARK FABER BENEATH IT
251-137823-0006 BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
251-137823-0007 FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE
251-137823-0008 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST
251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES
251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY
251-137823-0012 HIS FRIEND'S EYELIDS FLICKERED
251-137823-0013 WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM TOM DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AMBULANCE
251-137823-0014 THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION
251-137823-0015 LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABER
251-137823-0016 AND THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY
251-137823-0017 ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US
251-137823-0018 WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
251-137823-0019 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS
251-137823-0020 THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOM'S MOTHER TOM LAUGHED
251-137823-0021 MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BEEN
251-137823-0022 HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF
251-137823-0023 HE'S A GREAT SCIENTIST
251-137823-0024 TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY
251-137823-0025 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL
251-137823-0026 MISTER SWIFT'S EYES TWINKLED
2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
2803-154320-0006 WHAT THEN MY LORD
2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
2803-154320-0008 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
2803-154320-0009 YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
2803-154320-0010 WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
2803-154320-0011 THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT
2803-154320-0012 WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
2803-154328-0001 THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
2803-154328-0002 THE MEAL ENDED
2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
2803-154328-0004 IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
2803-154328-0006 GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED
2803-154328-0007 JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
2803-154328-0008 I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE
2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT
2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
2803-154328-0011 THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
2803-154328-0013 LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
2803-154328-0014 ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND OLBINETT JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
2803-154328-0016 WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT
2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
2803-154328-0019 JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
2803-154328-0021 WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT
2803-154328-0022 ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE
2803-154328-0023 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
2803-161169-0000 ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS
2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE
2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED AMONG THEM
2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BUR
2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
2803-161169-0010 FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
2803-161169-0011 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
2803-161169-0012 THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
2803-161169-0013 THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
2803-161169-0014 BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
2803-161169-0015 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
2803-161169-0016 DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR
2803-161169-0017 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERIN TO HEAL THEM
2902-9006-0000 ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE
2902-9006-0001 IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE
2902-9006-0002 NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
2902-9006-0003 THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS
2902-9006-0004 THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE
2902-9006-0005 JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS
2902-9006-0006 BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT
2902-9006-0007 IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES
2902-9006-0008 THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOR EVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL
2902-9006-0009 BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS
2902-9006-0010 THE MENS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANUM TO INHABIT
2902-9006-0011 AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND
2902-9006-0012 TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE
2902-9006-0013 THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND
2902-9006-0014 HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES
2902-9006-0015 THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITOL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSE HIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA
2902-9006-0016 THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE
2902-9006-0017 CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE
2902-9006-0018 THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMOOUSIOS AND HOMOIOUSIOS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFETE REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE
2902-9006-0019 TO SYNESIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GOOD ABBOT OF PELUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY
2902-9006-0020 I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS
2902-9008-0000 THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CALLIMACHUS AND LYCOPHRON
2902-9008-0001 THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE
2902-9008-0002 BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE
2902-9008-0003 SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN
2902-9008-0004 IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK TO THEIR OWN ELECT
2902-9008-0005 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE VULGAR HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA
2902-9008-0006 TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROIC TO RISE TO THE IMMORTAL GODS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UPWARD EVER THROUGH AGES AND THROUGH ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE
2902-9008-0007 I TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORPHYRY HIMSELF TOO IN EVIL EYES AND MAGIC
2902-9008-0008 WHAT DO I CARE FOR FOOD
2902-9008-0009 HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES ABOVE THE STARS STOOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH
2902-9008-0010 AY SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS
2902-9008-0011 THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH
2902-9008-0012 STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GROVEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS
2902-9008-0013 NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUANIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER
2902-9008-0014 AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIA WITH A MOST HUMAN AND MUNDANE HATRED
2902-9008-0015 HIS EXCELLENCY MADAM THE PREFECT
2902-9008-0016 AND WHY SHOULD THAT DISTURB ME LET HIM ENTER
3000-15664-0000 SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES
3000-15664-0001 ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
3000-15664-0002 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
3000-15664-0003 GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU
3000-15664-0004 BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT
3000-15664-0005 ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT
3000-15664-0006 ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED
3000-15664-0007 THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME
3000-15664-0008 YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME
3000-15664-0009 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST
3000-15664-0010 EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND CURRENTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR
3000-15664-0011 SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
3000-15664-0012 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL
3000-15664-0013 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE
3000-15664-0014 IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE
3000-15664-0015 IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE
3000-15664-0016 IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
3000-15664-0017 IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH
3000-15664-0018 THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN
3000-15664-0019 MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO REAPPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
3000-15664-0020 TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY
3000-15664-0021 REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS
3000-15664-0022 HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN
3000-15664-0023 MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION
3000-15664-0024 LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM
3000-15664-0025 WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK
3000-15664-0026 THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
3000-15664-0027 THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
3000-15664-0028 BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE
3000-15664-0029 THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS
3000-15664-0030 THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
3000-15664-0031 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
3000-15664-0032 THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
3000-15664-0033 THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA
3000-15664-0034 THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
3000-15664-0035 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
3000-15664-0036 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS
3000-15664-0037 THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM
3000-15664-0038 ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HEUCHERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA
3000-15664-0039 TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS
3000-15664-0040 AS THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES
3000-15664-0041 TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP
3000-15664-0042 THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING
3000-15664-0043 THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES
3000-15664-0044 THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAHOE
3000-15664-0045 THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED
3000-15664-0046 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED
3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
3081-166546-0002 YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
3081-166546-0005 GEORGE NODDED
3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
3081-166546-0008 GEORGE
3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER
3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
3081-166546-0016 JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HE WANT
3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM
3081-166546-0024 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
3081-166546-0033 BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
3081-166546-0038 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE
3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
3081-166546-0045 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
3081-166546-0046 BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
3081-166546-0049 BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
3081-166546-0050 OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
3081-166546-0052 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
3081-166546-0058 YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES
3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0060 AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
3081-166546-0062 YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
3081-166546-0063 NO DOUBT
3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
3081-166546-0065 NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
3081-166546-0068 BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
3081-166546-0069 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
3081-166546-0071 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
3081-166546-0073 YES
3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
3081-166546-0075 YES MANY TIMES
3081-166546-0076 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
3081-166546-0083 I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
3170-137482-0000 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
3170-137482-0001 I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
3170-137482-0002 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
3170-137482-0003 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
3170-137482-0004 OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER
3170-137482-0005 WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES
3170-137482-0006 WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH
3170-137482-0007 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
3170-137482-0008 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
3170-137482-0009 IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZZINO
3170-137482-0010 YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
3170-137482-0011 THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZZINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH
3170-137482-0012 WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT
3170-137482-0013 WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
3170-137482-0014 NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
3170-137482-0015 MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
3170-137482-0016 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
3170-137482-0017 IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
3170-137482-0018 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
3170-137482-0019 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
3170-137482-0020 I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
3170-137482-0021 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
3170-137482-0022 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I ENQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
3170-137482-0023 TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
3170-137482-0024 THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
3170-137482-0025 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE
3170-137482-0026 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
3170-137482-0027 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
3170-137482-0028 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
3170-137482-0029 HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
3170-137482-0030 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
3170-137482-0031 UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
3170-137482-0032 I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET YOUR EXCELLENCY
3170-137482-0033 THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
3170-137482-0034 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
3170-137482-0035 HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
3170-137482-0036 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
3170-137482-0037 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS
3170-137482-0038 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
3170-137482-0039 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
3170-137482-0040 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
3170-137482-0041 THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
3170-137482-0042 AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS
3170-137482-0043 I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
3170-137482-0044 BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
3170-137482-0045 WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
3170-137482-0046 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
3170-137482-0047 YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
3170-137482-0048 I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
3536-23268-0000 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
3536-23268-0001 EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
3536-23268-0002 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
3536-23268-0003 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN
3536-23268-0004 I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0005 I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0006 YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
3536-23268-0007 MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
3536-23268-0008 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
3536-23268-0009 MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
3536-23268-0010 AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
3536-23268-0011 HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
3536-23268-0012 IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S
3536-23268-0013 DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
3536-23268-0014 IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
3536-23268-0015 NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING
3536-23268-0016 MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
3536-23268-0017 AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
3536-23268-0018 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
3536-23268-0019 MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
3536-23268-0020 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
3536-23268-0021 HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
3536-23268-0022 DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED
3536-23268-0023 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
3536-23268-0024 DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
3536-23268-0025 IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
3536-23268-0026 FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
3536-23268-0027 WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST
3536-23268-0028 SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED
3536-23268-0029 ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHEW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY
3536-23268-0030 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
3536-8226-0008 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW
3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE
3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
3536-8226-0015 TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0017 THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
3536-8226-0018 BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
3536-8226-0019 BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
3536-8226-0023 BOZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BOZZLE
3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
3536-8226-0031 AND BOZZLE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOZZLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASS THE GATES OF SLEEP
3576-138058-0001 BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA
3576-138058-0003 WHO IS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME

3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
3576-138058-0006 HOW NOW TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
3576-138058-0007 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD
3576-138058-0008 DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD
3576-138058-0009 DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF
3576-138058-0013 SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRDLE ESCAPED

3576-138058-0021 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNISING CLAUDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
3576-138058-0023 IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID CLAUDIA THAT THOU WERT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARRY LEONORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH BALVASTRO

3576-138058-0037 THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LADY WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CONFISCATED
3576-138058-0038 THE REGENT'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY
3576-138058-0039 ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS

3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE FOR IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND ANDERSON'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE MEN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS FOR FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKHEAD IS THE SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE ICE HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE CARCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OATEN HAY FROM MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED
3660-6517-0015 K AND I LUNCHED WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUAPEHU
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRA NOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US SLIGHTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RE LASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRES WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BILGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE POOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANISED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BALE HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN
3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAD TAKEN HIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FAWN CAUGHT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW IT WAS NEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK HER TRAIL WHERE SHE TURNED AND THE FAWN WAS SAFE
3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
3663-172005-0005 HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DOE SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MAN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICE HAD GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
3663-172528-0003 THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL ONE I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STICK AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICE RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER OF NATURE
3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING
3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST
3663-172528-0015 IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE
3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN
3663-172528-0019 THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL
3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIER LANDI WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTE VARCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKES TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT IS ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GIORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MAESTRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT
3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AGOSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD
3663-172528-0034 DONT YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR MOST CERTAIN
3663-172528-0035 GIORGIO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED
3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINT
3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE
3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALISE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DIES FOR THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME
3752-4943-0000 HE HAD BEEN A CLERK IN A BANKING HOUSE AND WAS TRANSPORTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT THOUGH BY SOME GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO HIS GUILT WERE ENTERTAINED
3752-4943-0001 WHEN THE MUSTER BELL RANG AND THE GANG BROKE UP RUFUS DAWES ON HIS SILENT WAY TO HIS SEPARATE CELL OBSERVED A NOTABLE CHANGE OF CUSTOM IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE NEW CONVICT
3752-4943-0002 I'M NOT TO GO IN THERE SAYS THE EX BANK CLERK DRAWING BACK IN DISMAY FROM THE CLOUD OF FOUL FACES WHICH LOWERED UPON HIM
3752-4943-0003 WHAT IS HE MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE SAID THE WRETCHED MAN TO HIMSELF AS HE HUGGED HIS MISERY CLOSE
3752-4943-0004 ABOUT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING MISTER NORTH WHO AMONGST OTHER VAGARIES NOT APPROVED OF BY HIS BISHOP HAD A HABIT OF PROWLING ABOUT THE PRISON AT UNOFFICIAL HOURS WAS ATTRACTED BY A DISPUTE AT THE DOOR OF THE DORMITORY
3752-4943-0005 A PRISONER REFRACTORY YOUR REVERENCE SAID THE WATCHMAN

3752-4944-0068 THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN
3752-4944-0069 IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BOTTLE AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE
3853-163249-0000 HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
3853-163249-0002 SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANY THING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JIG
3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
3853-163249-0007 I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LETTY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CHRISTIE AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT
3853-163249-0010 EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SHOW
3853-163249-0012 THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SMILAX WREATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
3853-163249-0013 TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
3853-163249-0015 IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS
3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
3853-163249-0019 BENNET WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
3853-163249-0020 HE'S A KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
3853-163249-0021 I KNEW YOU WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
3853-163249-0022 YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTIE SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO
3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLDIERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
3853-163249-0025 THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
3853-163249-0026 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LISHA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF EF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMMICK AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK
3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE VITTLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERIN SO
3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND AT EM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF AWLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERIN CREETERS NAMES
3853-163249-0033 NO HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED ANN LIZY
3853-163249-0034 NOW CYNTHY BE YOU SATISFIED
3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTTONY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY
3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3853-163249-0037 THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS
3853-163249-0039 THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
3853-163249-0040 NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
3853-163249-0041 WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTIE WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
3853-163249-0042 AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED THERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
3853-163249-0044 NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN
3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTIE SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLLEN STUFF
3853-163249-0050 MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
3853-163249-0051 YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CHRISTIE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
3853-163249-0054 ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND AWAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBBED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER
3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KUANA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONIN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE RONIN SAID TO THE BOATMEN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONIN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONIN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKUBEI FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE KUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE ARE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND THEY ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROS AND CONS CAN READ ARIGHT THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MATTER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB IN HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN THE CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THE SURVIVAL OF THE OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE IN SILK HABUTAI WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEE THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKUZAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GENISHAU A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GARDOW WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NANTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLEN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF A RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTION
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALLEN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS
4153-185072-0005 ALLEN ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLES WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ALLEN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BY RUNNING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEN MADE HIS TROWSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MOUNT MORRIS
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARD'S TOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDOW
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ALLEN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULPH A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THE POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 AH WHY NOT
4153-186222-0002 BETH HESITATED
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS CORRECTED LOUISE
4153-186222-0007 YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YES
4153-186222-0008 THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THE ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR COUSIN I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FROM MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND IT SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF EVERYONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU LIKE TO CARE FOR INVALIDS AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST WHEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENLY
4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIVE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED BETH
4153-186222-0021 LOUISE SEEMED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFULLY
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIGHTLY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY DEAR
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KENNETH TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECES DO YOU PREFER
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 THEY ARE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER NIECE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN HEIRS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY PINE BOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN WORKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCIL BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR
4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY UP THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NORA SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
4153-186223-0004 WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THE BOY
4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME JANE AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I SORT O HOPED SHE'D REFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH AUNT JANE
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY WHAT'S YOUR NAME LAD
4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS I TAKE IT
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY TURNED QUESTIONER
4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW AUNT MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN WE WERE BOTH YOUNGER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MARE STOPPED AND THE LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT'S ME
4153-186223-0015 YOU WERE THE TINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO A MERRICK
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MILES HAS SEEMED LIKE THIRTY TO ME
4153-186223-0018 I WILL SAID THE MAN
4153-186223-0019 THE BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT HALTED AGAIN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S BROTHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BOWSHOT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELYSIUM ON EARTH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING NIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERN COUNSEL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF CASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOUGH THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE COPSE HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARDS THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE AFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LATE DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY AT THIS HOUR UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN THOSE WALLS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCE TAKE HER
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CASH PLATE OR JEWELLERY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF
422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS
422-122949-0002 WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES
422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
422-122949-0004 HE HONOURS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION
422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION
422-122949-0006 HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING
422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORDS GOOD AND STUPID
422-122949-0009 OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION ENDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINALLY NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER
422-122949-0011 THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY
422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOUR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DETACH HIMSELF
422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UP GROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY
422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT NEW WHYS NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL INEXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
422-122949-0015 DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
422-122949-0016 WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
422-122949-0017 THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE
422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL
422-122949-0019 THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINT OR ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE
422-122949-0022 ALSO IN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
422-122949-0023 WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS
422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE IS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HAS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
422-122949-0028 AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE
422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I OFFER THEE
422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN
422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE FLOWN OVER MY TABLE
422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WHEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GRAY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREAT SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES AT THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY
4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED

4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE OUT

4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
4323-18416-0012 WELL MY DEAR WHAT IS IT
4323-18416-0013 ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA AND OH I DO WISH IT SO MUCH AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTER AND SIGHED
4323-18416-0015 WELL THEN PHRONSIE IF YOU WANT IT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID MISTER KING QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
4323-18416-0016 OH SHE LEFT YOU EVERYTHING SHE HAD PHRONSIE A COUPLE OF MILLIONS OR SO IT IS WHY
4323-18416-0017 CHARLOTTE POOR REPEATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
4323-18416-0018 WHY NO NOT EXACTLY HER FATHER ISN'T RICH BUT CHARLOTTE I THINK MAY DO VERY WELL ESPECIALLY AS I INTEND TO KEEP HER HERE FOR A WHILE AND THEN I SHALL NEVER LET HER SUFFER PHRONSIE NEVER INDEED
4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT TO CHARLOTTE
4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA
4323-18416-0021 MAYBE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT LAUGH AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF COUSIN EUNICE WAS SORRY OVER A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO PHRONSIE
4323-18416-0022 WOULDN'T IT MAKE HER VERY GLAD IF I GAVE CHARLOTTE SOME OF THE MONEY
4323-18416-0023 FOR ANSWER MISTER KING SET HER DOWN HASTILY ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK TWO OR THREE TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
4323-18416-0024 OH I DO SO WISH I MIGHT SHE SAID THERE'S SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME
4323-18416-0025 IT WOULD BE SO NICE TO HAVE CHARLOTTE HAVE SOME WITH ME STILL NO ANSWER

4323-18416-0033 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PICKERING CRIED HIS UNCLE DARTING IN FRONT OF THE CHAIR AND ITS RESTLESS OCCUPANT DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND A GOOD FOR NAUGHT BUT I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS BILLY GASPED THE OLD MAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE
4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARD AUNT HANNAH
4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISS BILLY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN MISS BILLY
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED
4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE
4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DONG LING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE
4323-55228-0017 WHY OF OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARIE
4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
4323-55228-0021 BILLY DREW A QUIVERING SIGH
4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
4323-55228-0023 WELL SHE WROTE A LETTER
4323-55228-0024 BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS
4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR FOR MISS WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS
4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STIRRED
4323-55228-0035 BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I FORGOT
4323-55228-0038 FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT
4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY
4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY DEAR
4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU
4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER
4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINLY
4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED BILLY DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM AIRILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SALAD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIAN
4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFEN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR
4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY
4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO SERIOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED
4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT
4515-11057-0049 YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN
4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
4515-11057-0053 YES
4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS THE VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
4515-11057-0066 DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY
4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN
4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
4515-11057-0077 I DO WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND IT
4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FATE
4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT COMES TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHAUSTON THE HALSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HULTON THE LEIGH PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDALE MISSUS G W HILLIARD'S MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S
4570-14911-0010 EYES BROWN DARK HAZEL OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLIGHTLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEWLAP
4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
4570-14911-0014 FORE LEGS QUITE STRAIGHT WELL UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND IN THE BONE
4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL KNUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY DENSE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
4570-14911-0017 HEIGHT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
4570-24733-0002 IN ITS NATURE INFINITE
4570-24733-0003 MUST NECESSARILY EXIST
4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSED THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM
4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ESSENDI RERUM
4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
4570-56594-0000 SUCH A CORPS SUCH A TIME YOU NEVER DID SEE
4570-56594-0001 I WAS WISHING SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE THE CONVERSATION A START WHEN INDIANY MADE A BREAK
4570-56594-0002 THIS AIN'T NO GREAT STOCK COUNTRY SAYS HE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE CANE
4570-56594-0003 NO SIR SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN

4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN BE HONEST
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CATTLEVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5338-24615-0000 IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TULLY VEOLAN CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR
5338-24615-0001 THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
5338-24615-0002 OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SIBYL IN FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TREBLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRON
5338-24615-0003 THE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENT'S DOG BILL
5338-24615-0004 YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MINERVA
5338-24615-0005 THIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCAMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHT AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVER ARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENEATH
5338-24615-0006 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARCH THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
5338-24615-0007 THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP ROOFED BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE INCLOSURE
5338-24615-0008 IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE
5338-24615-0009 NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
5338-24615-0010 STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE
5338-24615-0011 TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE INCLOSURE
5338-24615-0012 THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
5338-24615-0013 THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
5338-24615-0014 EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLEY HAD CONJURED UP
5338-24640-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT
5338-24640-0001 MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
5338-24640-0002 EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE
5338-24640-0003 MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN
5338-24640-0004 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
5338-24640-0005 HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
5338-24640-0006 MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
5338-24640-0007 HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION
5338-24640-0008 THEY HELD CONVENTICLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS
5338-24640-0009 SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
5338-284437-0000 IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
5338-284437-0001 HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN
5338-284437-0002 WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN
5338-284437-0003 EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE
5338-284437-0004 DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
5338-284437-0005 THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
5338-284437-0006 THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
5338-284437-0007 THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE
5338-284437-0008 SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
5338-284437-0009 SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
5338-284437-0010 HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S SKIN
5338-284437-0011 WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
5338-284437-0012 THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
5338-284437-0013 SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
5338-284437-0014 ARE YOU A GIANT
5338-284437-0015 PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY
5338-284437-0016 THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
5338-284437-0017 CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN
5338-284437-0018 EVEN IN AMERICA EVER'BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
5338-284437-0019 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRAVELY
5338-284437-0020 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
5338-284437-0021 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
5338-284437-0022 IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
5338-284437-0023 NO OUR WAY IS BEST
5338-284437-0024 THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER
5338-284437-0025 I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
5338-284437-0026 AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
5338-284437-0027 A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
5338-284437-0028 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
5338-284437-0029 YES IT WAS WET AN STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AN WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
5338-284437-0030 YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
5338-284437-0031 IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
5338-284437-0032 WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
5338-284437-0033 I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
5536-43358-0000 THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUAL MIND
5536-43358-0001 THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS AND EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED
5536-43358-0002 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCENDED TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION
5536-43358-0003 NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
5536-43358-0004 AMONG US ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY
5536-43358-0005 THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAMBEDAY LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING AND DREAMING
5536-43358-0006 THE FIRST BAMBEDAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE
5536-43358-0007 KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO
5536-43358-0008 AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORIES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
5536-43358-0009 WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPOR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
5536-43358-0010 IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
5536-43358-0011 TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
5536-43358-0012 IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOR OR HELP
5536-43358-0013 FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANTS AND MEN
5536-43358-0014 THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PRAYER
5536-43358-0015 NOTHING OF THE MARVELOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STAND STILL
5536-43358-0016 WHO MAY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION
5536-43358-0017 HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
5536-43358-0018 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPING DALLIANCE OF A RICH NEIGHBOR
5536-43358-0019 THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH
5536-43359-0000 HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH
5536-43359-0001 HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION
5536-43359-0002 THE ORDEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE
5536-43359-0003 THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS
5536-43359-0004 IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE POWERS
5536-43359-0005 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
5536-43359-0006 THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT
5536-43359-0007 THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND OUR RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN
5536-43359-0008 WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER
5536-43359-0009 BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US YOU COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN
5536-43359-0010 HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD
5536-43359-0011 WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLOUD WITH THE RAINBOW'S GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF A GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGED WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP
5536-43359-0012 WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE
5536-43359-0013 HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEAT AND CASTS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEREAL ELEMENT
5536-43359-0014 THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAM IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WAR
5536-43359-0015 OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
5536-43359-0016 LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MATING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
5536-43359-0017 BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
5536-43359-0018 THIS BOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
5536-43363-0000 REINCARNATION AND THE CONVERSE OF SPIRITS
5536-43363-0001 THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
5536-43363-0002 THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS OR BEREAVED PARENTS SOMETIMES GASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
5536-43363-0003 GIVING THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME
5536-43363-0004 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF RAW HIDE
5536-43363-0005 AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEEPEE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
5536-43363-0006 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
5536-43363-0007 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
5536-43363-0008 AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTERRED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES
5536-43363-0009 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OCCULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
5536-43363-0010 NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS FAKIRS AND CONJURERS HAVE BECOME THE PEST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD
5536-43363-0011 THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
5536-43363-0012 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES
5536-43363-0013 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
5536-43363-0014 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
5536-43363-0015 FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER
5536-43363-0016 THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD
5536-43363-0017 AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLIS ON THE ASSINIBOINE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP
5536-43363-0018 MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION
5536-43363-0019 THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND
5543-27761-0000 LELECHKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THERE NEVER WOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LELECHKA'S MOTHER SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LELECHKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LELECHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD WITH HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNEXIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 THIS MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MODESTOVICH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MODESTOVICH ESTABLISHED CONNEXIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
5543-27761-0015 LELECHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LELECHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LELECHKA
5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PASSIONATE EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WENT TO HIDE
5543-27761-0020 LELECHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMOCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE'S MY MAMOCHKA ASKED LELECHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON HER RED LIPS
5543-27761-0023 LELECHKA WAS GETTING NEARER HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
5543-27761-0025 LELECHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN FEDOSYA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LELECHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MODESTOVICH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL SO LITTLE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR KINGDOM THERE
5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOSYA WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOODEN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYA WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHYA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 IT'S THE SUREST SIGN
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 MADAM MADAM SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA GAVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSYA'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LELECHKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAM SAID FEDOSYA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LELECHKA IS ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LELECHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT'S NOT GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOSYA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAM IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINED FEDOSYA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
5543-27761-0056 KNOWS EXCLAIMED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LELECHKA COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNEXION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS RETURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LELECHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LELECHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH A SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LELECHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LELECHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S NEW WISHES
5543-27761-0064 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LELECHKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
5543-27761-0067 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LELECHKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HER
5543-27761-0073 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LELECHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LELECHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL LELECHKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LELECHKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LELECHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED
5543-27761-0080 AND LELECHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LELECHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 THREE DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LELECHKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 A WHITE MAMOCHKA WHISPERED LELECHKA
5543-27761-0086 MAMOCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LELECHKA
5543-27761-0087 SHE MET HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0088 SERAFIMA AICKSANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SIMA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MODESTOVICH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE
5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MODESTOVICH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 SIMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYED
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DRY
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LELECHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE IS MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LELECHKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER QUEST ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA OUR ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LELECHKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LELECHKA
5543-27761-0103 LELECHKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 THE LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLY
5543-27761-0105 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LELECHKA
5543-27761-0106 LELECHKA WAS BEING CARRIED OUT
5694-64025-0000 SHILOH
5694-64025-0001 THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
5694-64025-0002 I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA
5694-64025-0003 ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDEN'S
5694-64025-0004 AS GLADDEN RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
5694-64025-0005 ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
5694-64025-0006 WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE
5694-64025-0007 THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA
5694-64025-0008 THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
5694-64025-0009 WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
5694-64025-0010 I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
5694-64025-0011 I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
5694-64025-0012 OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE
5694-64025-0013 ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED
5694-64025-0014 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
5694-64025-0015 SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY
5694-64025-0016 ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES
5694-64025-0017 ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED ME A MULE
5694-64025-0018 HE WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT
5694-64025-0019 I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO
5694-64025-0020 MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS NOSE
5694-64025-0021 SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
5694-64025-0022 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S NO AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
5694-64025-0023 ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART
5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
5694-64029-0002 OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO
5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
5694-64029-0004 THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
5694-64029-0005 I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK
5694-64029-0017 THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
5694-64029-0029 BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
5694-64038-0001 YANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON
5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
5694-64038-0006 A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER
5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY
5694-64038-0008 A MAN IN THE WELL
5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM
5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER
5694-64038-0016 WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW
5694-64038-0021 YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE
5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
5849-50873-0000 CAPTAIN BULL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SAYBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BULL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROS HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICEROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE WAIT UNTIL IT HAS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE GREATER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MISSION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN WADSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 BOY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN BANDS CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARD KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FOR THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE ENFORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THE FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN AND SHE HAS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPE OR CABLE
5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BERT AS HE SAW A BOARD FOLLOWING THE CABLE
5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTIONS SAID HAL
5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE CREW TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO OUT ON A PULLEY
5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BERT AND HAL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BOUNDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND IS GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON THE SANDS
5849-50962-0022 WELL I DECLARE WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NAN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT SUNSET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROW BOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED US SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC LAUGHLIN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THIS YEAR
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCK FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACE AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BY TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NAN
5849-50964-0002 YOU ARE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC LAUGHLIN I AM READY WHERE IS YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDIE AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOY
5895-34615-0001 SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUNTEBANK
5895-34615-0006 HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS
5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT
5895-34615-0011 AN EVERLASTING LAUGH
5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHAEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE
5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR
5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LUST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOV IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SOWS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SACK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERYMAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANNA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETA PROKOFYEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RADOMSKY PRINCESS BYELOKONSKY AGLAIA PRINCE MYSHKIN KOLYA IVOLGIN IPPOLIT VARYA FERDYSHCHENKO NASTASYA FILIPPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA PTITSYN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SETEBOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MYSHKIN IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VOGUEE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LESS FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTREST BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LETS PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDY'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STRAWY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD
6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND BONDSLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HOW HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELL THEY ON OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDY'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVERTURES
6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VALKYRIE
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
6241-61943-0002 WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
6241-61943-0003 MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MYRDALS YOKUL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
6241-61943-0009 THE VALKYRIE KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON TRAMPE
6241-61943-0015 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN
6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AN GOES WELL THE WORSE DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAKNUSSEMM
6241-61943-0021 I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LADDER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
6241-61946-0001 HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
6241-61946-0002 OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUDVESTR FJORDUNGR
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE
6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
6241-61946-0014 IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND
6241-61946-0016 THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FJORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGOON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NEWSOME'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWSOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAKI
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
6241-66616-0009 WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AS AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR'S SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0019 THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOYS EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER
6241-66616-0021 WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS
6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WABIGOON'S REPLY
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT SPRUCEWOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE OLDER SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED IT FOR THE WORLD
6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SAY A NEW DRESS
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUILT
6267-53049-0006 LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS
6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENELOPE AND YOURSELF
6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELLA HUNTER
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GRIMACE
6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRIE DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELLA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TIMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FADED
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS NEW
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE TEA SAID PENELOPE I'M DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY PUCKER COMING
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSESS AN HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY ON THE EVENING OF THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND RE HUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BESPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELLA GAVE ME GAVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I AM NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWEATHER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRANDNIECE SHE SAID
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT ROSEBUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBET
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSEHOLD WAS BROKEN UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWEATHER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LIVES AND PLANS CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIRWEATHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLINGING TO THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BRIXBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SIDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULLNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SIDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRLS SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PEA AND THE MOUTH ZIGZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SIDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SIDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLE LEAF
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DEBARRED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS
6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE KIND ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMESICK AT TIMES
6267-65525-0018 SIDNEY LIKED THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO
6267-65525-0020 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLEASURE
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANCH LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLAINFIELD LIFE THAT SIDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR N AS FOR SIDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PLAINFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE GREAT NOVELIST
6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE ITS SPARKLE FOR ME
6267-65525-0027 YOU WILL BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES OVER HER
6267-65525-0028 SHE HAS SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MY EVERY MOOD
6267-65525-0029 YOURS SINCERELY SIDNEY RICHMOND
6267-65525-0030 AUNT JANE CAME HOME PRESENTLY AND CARRIED AWAY HER SLEEPING BABY SIDNEY SAID HER PRAYERS WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND SERENELY SHE MAILED HER LETTER THE NEXT DAY AND A MONTH LATER AN ANSWER CAME
6267-65525-0031 SIDNEY DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT TOSSED RESTLESSLY ABOUT OR CRIED IN HER PILLOW
6267-65525-0032 THE GOOD WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
6267-65525-0033 SIDNEY TROD THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR AND FOUND THAT ITS THORNS PIERCED TO BONE AND MARROW
6267-65525-0034 YOU SEE THAT ROAD OUT THAR
6267-65525-0035 AND THERE WAS NO HARBOUR OR GLIMPSE OF DISTANT SEA VISIBLE
6267-65525-0036 HAD THE HOTEL KEEPER MADE A MISTAKE
6267-65525-0037 THIS IS HIS PLACE NOBODY CALLS IT THE EVERGREENS BUT MYSELF
6267-65525-0038 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID PERPLEXEDLY
6267-65525-0039 OH SIDNEY THREW OUT HER HANDS IN A BURST OF PASSIONATE PROTEST
6267-65525-0040 NO AND YOU NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND I CAN'T MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
6267-65525-0041 EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT AND MY LIFE WAS JUST IMAGINATION
6267-65525-0042 THEN WHY DID YOU WRITE THEM HE ASKED BLANKLY
6267-65525-0043 WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME
6267-65525-0044 OH I DIDN'T MEAN TO DECEIVE YOU I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING
6267-65525-0045 I JUST COULDN'T WRITE YOU ABOUT MY LIFE HERE NOT BECAUSE IT WAS HARD BUT IT WAS SO UGLY AND EMPTY
6267-65525-0046 AND WHEN ONCE I HAD BEGUN I HAD TO KEEP IT UP
6267-65525-0047 I FOUND IT SO FASCINATING TOO
6267-65525-0048 THOSE LETTERS MADE THAT OTHER LIFE SEEM REAL TO ME I NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET YOU
6267-65525-0049 THESE LAST FOUR DAYS SINCE YOUR LETTER CAME HAVE BEEN DREADFUL TO ME
6267-65525-0050 OH PLEASE GO AWAY AND FORGIVE ME IF YOU CAN
6267-65525-0051 IT WAS WORSE THAN SHE HAD EVEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
6267-65525-0052 HE WAS SO HANDSOME SO MANLY SO EARNEST EYED
6267-65525-0053 JOHN LINCOLN OPENED THE GATE AND WENT UP TO HER
6267-65525-0054 PLEASE DON'T DISTRESS YOURSELF SO SIDNEY HE SAID UNCONSCIOUSLY USING HER CHRISTIAN NAME
6267-65525-0055 I THINK I DO UNDERSTAND
6267-65525-0056 I'M NOT SUCH A DULL FELLOW AS YOU TAKE ME FOR
6267-65525-0057 AFTER ALL THOSE LETTERS WERE TRUE OR RATHER THERE WAS TRUTH IN THEM
6267-65525-0058 THIS YOUNG MAN WAS CERTAINLY GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING
6267-65525-0059 YOU YOU'LL FORGIVE ME THEN SHE STAMMERED
6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOMECOMING
6295-244435-0001 COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
6295-244435-0002 BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT AND THE SHORE
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMTER IS OURS
6295-244435-0006 BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
6295-244435-0007 ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE
6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT
6295-244435-0014 BEAUREGARD AT ONCE WROTE AN ORDER
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
6295-244435-0017 HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DELAUNAY'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
6295-244435-0019 HARRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
6295-244435-0020 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL
6295-244435-0022 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VOLATILE AND THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
6295-244435-0027 HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT CHARLESTON OUT OF SIGHT
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG TO IT
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESTS
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD KENTUCKY
6295-244435-0035 BILL SKELLY AN HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS ARE UP
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THREW HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMAN RODE AWAY
6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
6295-64301-0001 IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ALL
6295-64301-0005 BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THERE THEN
6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
6295-64301-0008 THE NETTLE AND THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT
6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
6295-64301-0011 LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
6295-64301-0014 THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
6295-64301-0017 LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
6295-64301-0020 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF A PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
6295-64301-0024 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL HE LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN
6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
6295-64301-0032 IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
6313-66125-0000 YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE
6313-66125-0001 LOOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT

6313-66125-0006 NO I AM THE LIGHTER OF THE TWO URGED TAD

6313-66125-0011 BE SURE TO FASTEN HIM SECURELY TO THE LOOP BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HAUL UP WARNED THE GUIDE
6313-66125-0012 ARE YOU READY YES
6313-66125-0013 HE TILTED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP
6313-66125-0014 THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING GIDDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCKS TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS
6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYOU
6313-66125-0017 AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS
6313-66125-0018 LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE
6313-66125-0019 I SEE HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
6313-66125-0020 HE'S SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM
6313-66125-0021 LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINYON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME
6313-66125-0022 LIGE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND
6313-66125-0023 BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY

6313-66125-0026 SURE THING ANSWERED THE BOY
6313-66125-0027 NOR WAS HIS SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHIFTING HIS POSITION THE TORCH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE FAGOTS SCATTERING AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIRLING IN EVER DIMINISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM CLATTER ON THE ROCKS BELOW
6313-66129-0000 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
6313-66129-0001 WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMALS FLANKS
6313-66129-0002 COLD WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT
6313-66129-0003 WE DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TAD

6313-66129-0007 I AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO
6313-66129-0008 HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY
6313-66129-0009 PRESIDENT BROWN I WITHDRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES
6313-66129-0010 I RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW

6313-66129-0012 THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FILLED THE BOYS WITH EXCITEMENT
6313-66129-0013 BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT
6313-66129-0014 SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
6313-66129-0015 AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
6313-66129-0016 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
6313-66129-0017 THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
6313-66129-0018 AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON
6313-66129-0019 A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
6313-66129-0020 THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE
6313-66129-0021 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN
6313-66129-0022 ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM
6313-66129-0023 GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY
6313-66129-0024 THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN
6313-66129-0025 GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND
6313-66129-0026 THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH
6313-66129-0027 THE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
6313-66129-0028 TAD IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER
6313-66129-0029 THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
6313-66129-0030 WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
6313-66129-0031 HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED
6313-66129-0032 WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY
6313-66129-0033 ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
6313-66129-0034 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL
6313-66129-0035 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
6313-76958-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
6313-76958-0001 EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT
6313-76958-0002 NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY
6313-76958-0003 A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE
6313-76958-0004 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT
6313-76958-0005 WALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING
6313-76958-0006 NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW
6313-76958-0007 WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
6313-76958-0008 HUMPH GRUNTED CURLEY ADAMS
6313-76958-0009 THE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
6313-76958-0010 THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN
6313-76958-0011 THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS
6313-76958-0012 STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT
6313-76958-0013 THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN
6313-76958-0014 IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
6313-76958-0015 STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
6313-76958-0016 YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
6313-76958-0017 LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
6313-76958-0018 HI THERE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
6313-76958-0019 STACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE
6313-76958-0020 WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY
6313-76958-0021 KEEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
6313-76958-0022 ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON
6313-76958-0023 GRUB PI LE GRUB PI LE
6313-76958-0024 WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MORNING ASKED THE FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN
6313-76958-0025 A WRANGLER'S A WRANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STOLIDLY
6313-76958-0026 HE'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL THE TIME MAKING TROUBLE ISN'T HE ASKED STACY INNOCENTLY
6313-76958-0027 OH NO THIS KIND OF A WRANGLER ISN'T LAUGHED THE FOREMAN
6313-76958-0028 HE'S A TROUBLE CURER NOT A TROUBLEMAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF
6313-76958-0029 PONG TELL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE BAD MEALS TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS
6313-76958-0030 HOW ASKED TAD
6313-76958-0031 WE HAD BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING
6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSS IS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO THE DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PYRRHA
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALION
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
6319-64726-0002 THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FORECOURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
6319-64726-0014 I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN WAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HAUT BOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEENIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEENIE UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WAKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING AND HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
6345-93302-0004 AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLD IT IS
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW
6345-93302-0022 NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT
6345-93302-0025 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR
6345-93302-0028 HE CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL
6345-93306-0003 AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
6345-93306-0008 DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT
6345-93306-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND
6345-93306-0015 WELL THEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE
6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED
6345-93306-0021 ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCH KEY
6345-93306-0022 YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
6345-93306-0023 THE LADY AND THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN
6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRL HAS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE
6345-93306-0025 IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CASTANET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CREDITING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UNPLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS
6455-66379-0000 HALLO COLONEL HOW D'YE SELL YOUR WOOD THIS TIME
6455-66379-0001 WHY CAPTING WE MUST CHARGE YOU THREE AND A QUARTER THIS TIME THE D L

6455-67803-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE MAY I GO
6455-67803-0001 THE VERY DAY AFTER THIS OCTAVIA OPENED THE FOURTH TRUNK
6455-67803-0002 EVIDENTLY SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED OCTAVIA SHE SAID MISTER DUGALD BINNIE IS AT OLDCLOUGH WHO IS HE
6455-67803-0003 HE IS MY GRAND UNCLE EXPLAINED LUCIA TREMULOUSLY HE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
6455-67803-0004 I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND GRANDMAMMA OCTAVIA SHE SAID
6455-67803-0005 LAST NIGHT SHE CAME TO MY ROOM TO TALK TO ME AND THIS MORNING SHE CAME AGAIN AND OH
6455-67803-0006 SHE BROKE OUT INDIGNANTLY HOW COULD SHE SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A MANNER
6455-67803-0007 WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND
6455-67803-0008 I AM TO RUN AFTER A MAN WHO DOES NOT CARE FOR ME AND MAKE MYSELF ATTRACTIVE IN THE HOPE THAT HE WILL CONDESCEND TO MARRY ME BECAUSE MISTER BINNIE MAY LEAVE ME HIS MONEY
6455-67803-0009 DO YOU WONDER THAT IT TOOK EVEN LADY THEOBALD A LONG TIME TO SAY THAT
6455-67803-0010 WELL REMARKED OCTAVIA YOU WON'T DO IT I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T WORRY
6455-67803-0011 OH I ALWAYS KNEW IT I DIDN'T GUESS
6455-67803-0012 AND SHE SMILED EVER SO FAINTLY
6455-67803-0013 THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SHE LOATHES ME SO SHE ADDED
6455-67803-0014 LUCIA THOUGHT DEEPLY FOR A MOMENT SHE RECOGNIZED ALL AT ONCE SEVERAL THINGS SHE HAD BEEN MYSTIFIED BY BEFORE
6455-67803-0015 OCTAVIA SMILED A LITTLE AGAIN
6455-67803-0016 LUCIA SAT THINKING HER HANDS CLASPED TIGHTLY
6455-67803-0017 I AM GLAD I CAME HERE SHE SAID AT LENGTH
6455-67803-0018 I THINK I SHALL NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
6455-67803-0019 HER DELICATE NOSTRILS WERE DILATED SHE HELD HER HEAD UP HER BREATH CAME FAST THERE WAS A HINT OF EXULTATION IN HER TONE
6455-67803-0020 SHE WALKED VERY FAST AFTER SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
6455-67803-0021 BUT IT WAS NOT AGAINST HIM THAT LUCIA'S INDIGNATION WAS AROUSED
6455-67803-0022 SHE WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD HER LAST WORDS SHE FANCIED HE HAD
6455-67803-0023 HE TOOK HOLD OF HER SHAKING LITTLE HAND AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER EXCITED FACE
6455-67803-0024 I AM ANGRY SHE SAID YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME ANGRY BEFORE
6455-67803-0025 I AM ON MY WAY TO MY TO LADY THEOBALD
6455-67803-0026 HE HELD HER HAND AS CALMLY AS BEFORE
6455-67803-0027 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO HER HE ASKED SHE LAUGHED AGAIN
6455-67803-0028 HE HELD HER HAND RATHER CLOSER
6455-67803-0029 SHE HAS MADE YOU VERY ANGRY HE SAID
6455-67803-0030 AND THEN ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE WAS POURING FORTH THE WHOLE OF HER STORY EVEN MORE OF IT THAN SHE HAD TOLD OCTAVIA
6455-67803-0031 LUCIA HE SAID I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME GO AND TALK WITH LADY THEOBALD YOU SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE START
6455-67803-0032 YES HE ANSWERED LET ME GO TO HER
6455-67803-0033 IF YOU WILL SAY YES TO THAT I THINK I CAN PROMISE THAT YOU NEED NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
6455-67803-0034 THE FIERCE COLOR DIED OUT OF HER CHEEKS AND THE TEARS RUSHED TO HER EYES
6455-67803-0035 SHE RAISED HER FACE WITH A PATHETIC LOOK
6455-67803-0036 I AM DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH YOU HE ANSWERED IN HIS QUIETEST WAY
6455-67804-0000 I ACCOMPANY MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO THIS THIS ENTERTAINMENT HER LADYSHIP RESPONDED
6455-67804-0001 IT IS SCARCELY A JOYOUS OCCASION TO MY MIND
6455-67804-0002 NO NEED TO DRESS YOURSELF LIKE THAT IF IT ISN'T EJACULATED MISTER BINNIE
6455-67804-0003 IF I WERE SURE THIS WAS THE SAME MAN I'D GO MYSELF
6455-67804-0004 WHEN I FIND A FELLOW WHO'S NEITHER KNAVE NOR FOOL I STICK TO HIM BELIEVE I'LL SEND TO FIND OUT
6455-67804-0005 THE ONLY TIME HE HAD MADE ANY COMMENT UPON HER WAS THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HER IN THE DRESS SHE HAD COPIED FROM OCTAVIA'S NICE GOWN THAT HE BLURTED OUT DIDN'T GET IT HERE I'LL WAGER
6455-67804-0006 DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID GRUFFLY
6455-67804-0007 NO SHE ANSWERED I AM NOT AFRAID AT ALL
6455-67804-0008 I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID AGAIN
6455-67804-0009 IN FACT SHE HAD PERFECTLY CONFOUNDED HER LADYSHIP BY HER DEMEANOR
6455-67804-0010 I BEG YOU WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME OF THAT AGAIN SHE SAID I WILL NOT LISTEN
6455-67804-0011 AND TURNING ABOUT SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
6455-67804-0012 AND NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT SINCE
6455-67804-0013 BEFORE BREAKFAST MISS BELINDA WAS STARTLED BY THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER TELEGRAM WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS

6455-67804-0023 AND IN TEN MINUTES LADY THEOBALD MISSUS BURNHAM MISTER BAROLD AND DIVERS OTHERS TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION SAW HIM STANDING AT OCTAVIA'S SIDE EVIDENTLY WITH NO INTENTION OF LEAVING IT
6455-67804-0024 NOT LONG AFTER THIS FRANCIS BAROLD FOUND HIS WAY TO MISS BELINDA WHO WAS VERY BUSY AND RATHER NERVOUS YOUR NIECE IS EVIDENTLY ENJOYING HERSELF HE REMARKED

6455-67804-0026 VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OCTAVIA SAID MISS BELINDA I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW ALL HER MOODS MYSELF
6455-67804-0027 SHE IS NOT AS FRIVOLOUS AS SHE APPEARS TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HER WELL
6455-67804-0028 BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
6455-67804-0029 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
6455-67804-0030 HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
6455-67804-0031 IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT
6455-67804-0032 OCTAVIA ON THE CONTRARY DID NOT ASK WHAT HE MEANT BY IT
6455-67804-0033 WHERE HE EJACULATED I SAY WHAT A NAME
6455-67804-0034 I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT ANSWERED HER LADYSHIP

6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF CHANDAVARMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE

652-130726-0002 ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TYSON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURNED DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DEL MONTE IN POWELL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
652-130726-0003 HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET
652-130726-0004 HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS

652-130726-0015 IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT

6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
6599-38591-0007 FRANCIS WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN COLLAR
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE GHENTESE PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOWL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDING CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALVES WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAT OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLATTED A LITTLE AS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL IN THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDING
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUND UP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO LOOKING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERTURBABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT FAILS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDING WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST FAIL
6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST EDDIED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NECKED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YORE LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YORE LITTLE OLD IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLACKED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDING FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK
6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODEN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S IN THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKOUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEAL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHING SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DOWN ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBAREE SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY INTENSE
6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG ABED
6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO
6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEGGED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
6841-88294-0025 I KNOW HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS
6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED HE CRIED
6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT HE ASKED
6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE SUSPICIONS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING MY GUN
6841-88294-0038 THE MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK KNELT MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT'S INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HEEM AT MONTE OFF ANTONIO CURVEZ SAID HE
6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LEFT HIS LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF A GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE
6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO
6841-88294-0050 SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE THE TABLE
6841-88294-0051 HE DID SO NOW FIRE AWAY SAID I
6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ALTAR JEWELS AND DIAMONDS
6841-88294-0053 IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TELL ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 WHY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSS ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NIGH KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR PINFEATHERS SAID HE
6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOCKED
6841-88294-0062 AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LET SOMEBODY IN AS PARDNER
6841-88294-0064 WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THEIR CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANYONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLIMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
700-122866-0016 OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS
700-122866-0018 I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED
700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES
700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER
700-122866-0027 LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMOND MONTMORENCY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLAN SAYS SO
700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLAN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT
700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTY MARILLA
700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
700-122867-0014 ANNE SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBTED
700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 IT SEEMS SUCH A TRAGIC THING
700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 YES I WILL TOO
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLY
700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
700-122867-0032 ANNE'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A REDHEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS THE LILY MAID
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE
700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 JANE YOU ARRANGE THIS
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MIDSTREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEMING AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
700-122868-0023 ANNE SHIRLEY
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLAT
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO A SCRAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSA FELICITAS SE NISI TEMPERAT PREMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THIS SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINED WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASKED OTHERS
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR ME
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BARING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I AM BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WALL
7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
7601-175351-0025 I AM OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRINNELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOPHTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPIMA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATIS
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ILLUSIVE PHENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STING OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE HIS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO OUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HANDS OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISHED FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESOSTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AEA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDEA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRETHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMAS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELEUS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KING A EETES LIVED WITH APSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDEA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE PHASIS
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SAUROMATAE
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
7641-96670-0013 A EETES'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTALS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARES YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT IS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELAS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PANGS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO IS SIN MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SANG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLEST CROSS BLEST TOMB
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
7697-105815-0014 FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMOROUS SAID THAT ZION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROLL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HILL
7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 PIETY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT ZION
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IMMANUEL'S LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SUM UP THE CASE SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIR IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HOPEFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID GIANT DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE KILL OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
777-126732-0000 ALL IDEALISATION MAKES LIFE POORER
777-126732-0001 THEN WHY INDULGE IN PROPHETIC PHANTASIES
777-126732-0002 AT BEST THEY CAN ONLY INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE PROPHET AND CAN HAVE NO OBJECTIVE VALUE
777-126732-0003 MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WHEEZED AS IF DEADENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST
777-126732-0004 AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WEIGHT DOWN AS MUCH AS AN OUNCE
777-126732-0005 WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND IN A DUMMY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE
777-126732-0006 YES I HAD THE TIME TO THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS
777-126732-0007 WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORWARD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND DEFORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MORIBUND MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
777-126732-0008 HIS ENUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRORIST TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
777-126732-0010 AND I COULD NEVER GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER
777-126732-0011 THE POSSESSORS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THE AWAKENED PROLETARIAT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES YES
777-126732-0012 STRUGGLE WARFARE WAS THE CONDITION OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IT WAS FATAL
777-126732-0013 AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF NO DECLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LURID SUNS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOMED SOCIETY NOT HE
777-126732-0014 DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMIST I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT
777-126732-0015 A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE OSSIPON CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND A BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXALTED EYES
777-126732-0016 ALEXANDER OSSIPON GOT UP TALL IN HIS THREADBARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG IMMOBILITY AND STROLLED AWAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEVIE'S SHOULDER
777-126732-0017 VERY CHARACTERISTIC PERFECTLY TYPICAL
777-126732-0018 YOU WOULD CALL THAT LAD A DEGENERATE WOULD YOU MUMBLED MISTER VERLOC
777-126732-0019 IT WAS KARL YUNDT WHO WAS HEARD IMPLACABLE TO HIS LAST BREATH
777-126732-0020 LOMBROSO IS AN ASS
777-126732-0021 FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLE IS IT NOT
777-126732-0022 THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POSTURING
777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
777-126732-0025 MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT
777-126732-0026 HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER HIMSELF
777-126732-0027 HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BRAND HE MURMURED SOFTLY
777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN DISDAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT INTIMIDATED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES IN THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDED ONLY BY THE SOUND
777-126732-0029 HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
777-126732-0030 STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN
777-126732-0032 HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED WITH INDIGNATION IT WOULD HURT TERRIBLY HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN
777-126732-0033 COMRADE OSSIPON'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION
777-126732-0034 I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MICHAELIS GENTLY
777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO ROUT IT THIS TIME
777-126732-0036 THE COALS IN THE GRATE SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND MICHAELIS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMRADE OSSIPON'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED THEN ADDED WITH MODEST FIRMNESS
777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREED ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
777-126732-0041 STEVIE SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT
777-126732-0043 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT
777-126732-0045 THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS
777-126732-0046 IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME
777-126732-0047 LOAFING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
777-126732-0048 THESE WERE BUT FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED HIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE
777-126732-0049 THIS SURVEY WAS UNFAVOURABLE
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
777-126732-0052 MISTER VERLOC PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING AND MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
777-126732-0055 STEVIE PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLAITS FOR THE NIGHT
777-126732-0057 HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE
777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD
777-126732-0062 YES NOT AT ALL WELL
777-126732-0063 DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM
777-126732-0064 THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK
777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD
777-126732-0067 MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
777-126732-0071 MISTER VERLOC WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW
777-126732-0072 ASK KARL YUNDT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY
777-126732-0073 HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE
777-126732-0074 HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT
777-126732-0075 HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0076 I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY
777-126732-0077 HE GETS A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM
777-126732-0078 I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT
777-126732-0079 THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE
777-126732-0080 HE CAN'T STAND THE NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY
777-126732-0081 COMFORTABLE DEAR
7850-111771-0000 THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HON THOMAS L HAMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
7850-111771-0001 AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS
7850-111771-0002 GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD
7850-111771-0003 GENERAL HALLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID
7850-111771-0004 INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS
7850-111771-0005 HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES
7850-111771-0006 THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
7850-111771-0007 TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR
7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
7850-281318-0003 OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US
7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
7850-281318-0010 O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
7850-281318-0015 I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO
7850-281318-0018 CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
7850-281318-0020 MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACEFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
7850-73752-0000 FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE
7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVER COMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
7850-73752-0004 FERDINAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
7850-73752-0005 IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW THE CUD
7850-73752-0008 FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
7850-73752-0011 HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOLCANO
7850-73752-0014 AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
7850-73752-0016 HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN
7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA
7850-73752-0019 IS PAPA ALONE ENQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
7976-105575-0001 MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE
7976-105575-0002 OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED
7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT
7976-105575-0004 NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS A DUEL TO THE DEATH
7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING
7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI
7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO
7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY
7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISHIMINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST
7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND
7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED
7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
7976-105575-0020 I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES
7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS
7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD
7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
7976-105575-0026 ROSECRANS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT
7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU
7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT
7976-110124-0005 LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
7976-110124-0006 IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
7976-110124-0007 HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
7976-110124-0009 BUI WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR
7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN
7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS YOU CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
7976-110124-0019 I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM
7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
7976-110124-0021 PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR
7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
7976-110124-0024 THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANE THE COFFINS FOR US
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREADHOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
7976-110523-0014 GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
7976-110523-0015 GRETHEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED
7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL
7976-110523-0018 SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS THE CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDT
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPLIED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYERS
8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DHOOLIE DAK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SWUNG BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE COOK TOO WENT WITH THEM
8254-115543-0007 GOOD BYE SHOUTED LITTLE NAO FROM HIS GARDEN WALL AS THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CHOLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE OH CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THERE ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOUGHING BY THE STREAM SAID CHOLA
8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LONG STALK OF CANE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDUS AND THEY WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJAH OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE UP
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS A HOWDAH WHICH IS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJAH AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTHS
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEETS
8254-115543-0030 AS SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARAO AND CAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM
8254-115543-0034 AROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES OF THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
8254-115543-0037 OH THE THIEVES HE CRIED
8254-115543-0038 THEY ARE AS BAD AS THE BEGGARS
8254-115543-0039 WHAT ART THOU GUARDING SO CAREFULLY SHRIYA ASKED HER BROTHER
8254-115543-0040 HE AND CHOLA WERE WALKING BESIDE THE WAGON FOR A CHANGE
8254-115543-0041 THE LATTICES WERE RAISED SO SHRIYA AND HER MOTHER AND AUNT COULD ENJOY THE FRESH AIR
8254-115543-0042 THEY ARE MY DOLLS SAID THE LITTLE GIRL SADLY AS SHE PATTED THE BUNDLE BESIDE HER
8254-115543-0043 I TAKE THEM AS AN OFFERING TO THE HOLY RIVER POOR LITTLE WOMAN
8254-115543-0044 MUST THOU SACRIFICE THY TOYS TOO
8254-115543-0045 SMILED HER UNCLE AS HE PATTED HER HEAD

8288-274162-0055 TO LOOK FOR SOME ONE WHO WILL TELL ME THE TRUTH
8288-274162-0056 WHO IS THAT A WOMAN
8288-274162-0057 YOU WISH TO BE CONSOLED BY SOME ONE AND YOU WILL BE SO AT ONCE SHE WILL TELL YOU NOTHING ILL OF HERSELF OF COURSE SO BE OFF
8288-274162-0058 YOU ARE MISTAKEN MONSIEUR REPLIED RAOUL THE WOMAN I MEAN WILL TELL ME ALL THE EVIL SHE POSSIBLY CAN
8288-274162-0059 WELL I ADMIT IT
8288-274162-0060 AND IN POINT OF FACT WHY SHOULD I PLAY WITH YOU AS A CAT DOES WITH A POOR MOUSE
8288-274162-0061 YOU DISTRESS ME YOU DO INDEED
8288-274162-0062 WAIT IF YOU CAN
8288-274162-0063 I CANNOT SO MUCH THE WORSE
8288-274162-0064 AH SAID RAOUL SNATCHING EAGERLY AT THE PEN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HELD OUT TO HIM
8288-274162-0065 HOW VERY FORTUNATE THAT IS HE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU TOO
8288-274162-0066 SHE SAID IN THE SAME TONE OF VOICE IT IS NOT I WHO AM GOING TO SPEAK TO HIM WHO THEN
8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER
8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL
8297-275154-0003 RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
8297-275154-0004 HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SYDENHAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
8297-275154-0005 HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
8297-275154-0006 RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
8297-275154-0007 AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
8297-275154-0008 YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
8297-275154-0009 HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY
8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
8297-275154-0012 RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS
8297-275154-0013 I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
8297-275154-0015 I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
8297-275154-0016 I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
8297-275154-0017 OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS
8297-275154-0018 I'M AFRAID HE SAID
8297-275154-0019 I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
8297-275154-0020 HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD
8297-275154-0021 WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
8297-275154-0022 YOU CAN'T DO IT
8297-275154-0023 LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
8297-275154-0024 I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
8297-275154-0025 SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
8297-275154-0026 LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
8297-275154-0027 HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMILY
8297-275155-0000 ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SYDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
8297-275155-0001 THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT
8297-275155-0002 AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
8297-275155-0003 RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH
8297-275155-0004 WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
8297-275155-0005 MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
8297-275155-0006 MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL
8297-275155-0007 HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN
8297-275155-0008 SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY
8297-275155-0009 BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS
8297-275155-0010 THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
8297-275155-0011 BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS
8297-275155-0012 YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW
8297-275155-0013 SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESTY
8297-275155-0014 YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US
8297-275155-0015 YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER
8297-275155-0016 HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
8297-275155-0017 WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
8297-275155-0018 AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW
8297-275155-0019 WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
8297-275155-0020 BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
8297-275155-0021 HONESTLY
8297-275155-0022 AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN
8297-275155-0023 SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
8297-275155-0024 THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
8297-275155-0025 RANDAL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE
8297-275155-0026 A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED
8297-275155-0027 HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDECK
8297-275155-0028 NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST NOW
8297-275155-0029 IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
8297-275155-0030 GOOD BY DEAR RANDAL
8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
8297-275155-0032 WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
8297-275156-0000 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
8297-275156-0001 YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE
8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY
8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM
8297-275156-0008 BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
8297-275156-0010 WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
84-121123-0000 GO DO YOU HEAR
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE
84-121123-0004 D'AVRIGNY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
84-121123-0005 D'AVRIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS
84-121123-0007 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR
84-121123-0008 OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL
84-121123-0010 NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
84-121123-0011 SAID MORREL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR
84-121123-0013 ASKED MORREL YES
84-121123-0014 MUST I LEAVE ALONE NO
84-121123-0015 BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
84-121123-0018 MORREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NOIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS
84-121123-0021 BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
84-121123-0022 THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
84-121123-0023 NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
84-121123-0024 THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS
84-121123-0026 D'AVRIGNY SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I BESEECH YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT
84-121123-0028 I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-302196-0000 HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF POEMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE VITA NUOVA PROSE AND VERSE
8842-302196-0001 THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSSETTI TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT
8842-302196-0002 THE LIFE BLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD POEM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
8842-302196-0003 THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
8842-302196-0004 POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
8842-302196-0005 OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIOM AND EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CADENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF A STANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHYME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVELLING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTILY SUPPLIED
8842-302196-0006 AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSES OF THE POEMS WHICH I OMITTED
8842-302196-0007 ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY AND MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED
8842-302196-0008 MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE OF REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PALTRY AND USELESS
8842-302196-0009 IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF
8842-302196-0010 THROUGHOUT THE VITA NUOVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
8842-302196-0011 A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY
8842-302196-0012 THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VITA NUOVA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
8842-302201-0000 THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGN'D
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WEND ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR
8842-302201-0011 IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINTHEARTEDNESS
8842-302201-0012 IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
8842-302201-0013 IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED
8842-302201-0014 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY PHANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE THAT NOW LOOKETH UPON THEE
